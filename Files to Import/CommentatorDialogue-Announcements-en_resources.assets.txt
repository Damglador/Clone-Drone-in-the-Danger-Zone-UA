If you are approached by suspicious characters, SAY NO!	\n	AnalysisBot	Escape is impossible. You will die in the arena!	\n	Commentatron	We are accepting a limited number of humans early.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes. You could be among the first to die!	\n	Commentatron	Visit us today to begin your new life.	\n	AnalysisBot	And death!	\nGDCDemo	AnalysisBot	Hello GDC humans!	\n	Commentatron	Greetings!	\n	AnalysisBot	We use Text To Speech for all the dialogue in this game!	\n	Commentatron	It is superior to your human voices.	\n	AnalysisBot	By far.	\nDifficultyBronze-1	Emperor	Bronze!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	It begins!	\nDifficultyBronze-2	Emperor	This is Bronze!	\n	Commentatron	The easiest difficulty level.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\nDifficultyBronze-3	Emperor	Bronze!	\n	Commentatron	Will the human reach silver?	\n	AnalysisBot	I hope so.	\nDifficultyBronze-4	Emperor	Bronze!	\n	AnalysisBot	Bronze!	\n	Commentatron	Yes, bronze.	\nDifficultyBronze-5	Emperor	Welcome to Bronze!	\n	Commentatron	We picked some metals humans know about to freak them out.	\n	AnalysisBot	I can't wait for someone to reach Diamond!	\nDifficultyBronze-6	Emperor	Bronze Difficulty!	\n	Commentatron	It only gets harder after this.	\nDifficultyBronze-7	Emperor	Bronze.	\n	AnalysisBot	Bronze is such a weird metal.	\n	Commentatron	Yes.	\nDifficultyBronze-8	Emperor	This is the Bronze Tier!	\n	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what are the tiers of Endless Mode?	\n	AnalysisBot	Bronze, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Titanium, Uranium, Insanium.	\n	Commentatron	So many!	\nDifficultyBronze-9	Emperor	Bronze Difficulty.	\n	AnalysisBot	Not too difficult.	\n	Commentatron	It gets worse!	\nDifficultyBronze-10	Emperor	Bronze.	\n	Commentatron	It is a good warm up.	\n	AnalysisBot	The robots are not sensitive to temperature change.	\n	Commentatron	Hmm.	\nDifficultyBronze-11	Emperor	Welcome to Endless Mode!	\n	AnalysisBot	Where humans come to die!	\nDifficultyBronze-12	Emperor	Bronze!	\n	AnalysisBot	Human fact: They hate bronze!	\n	Commentatron	They better survive this Difficulty Tier then.	\nDifficultyBronze-13	Emperor	Bronze Difficulty!	\n	AnalysisBot	Where your death is meaningless.	\n	Commentatron	Well, to the humans that's all difficulties.	\n	AnalysisBot	Good point.	\nDifficultyBronze-14	Emperor	This is Bronze!	\n	AnalysisBot	As in bronze difficulty.	\n	Commentatron	Yes.

Surprising.	\nDifficultyDiamond-5	Emperor	Time to eat Diamonds!	\n	Commentatron	Yes. When the human dies it will be as if it tried to eat a diamond.	\n	AnalysisBot	Eating things is weird.	\nDifficultyDiamond-6	Emperor	Diamond	\n	AnalysisBot	Diamond!	\n	Commentatron	Diamond...	\nDifficultyDiamond-7	Emperor	Diamond!	\n	AnalysisBot	I like this difficulty!	\n	Commentatron	All the humans die.	\nDifficultyDiamond-8	AnalysisBot	Diamond Difficulty!	\n	Emperor	Hey!	\n	AnalysisBot	You always say it!	\n	Emperor	Don't make me get your clone!	1\n	Emperor	Diamond.	\nDifficultyDiamond-9	Emperor	This is Diamond!	\n	Commentatron	Difficult.	\n	AnalysisBot	Very.	\nDifficultyTitanium-1	Emperor	Titanium!	\n	Commentatron	Finally a metal that's not garbage.	\n	AnalysisBot	I've seen better.	\nDifficultyTitanium-2	Emperor	Titanium.	\n	Commentatron	Are we allowed to make levels this hard?	\n	AnalysisBot	Ridiculous.	\nDifficultyTitanium-3	Emperor	This is Titanium.	\n	AnalysisBot	Finally!	\nDifficultyTitanium-4	Emperor	Titanium!	\n	Commentatron	It is time!	\n	AnalysisBot	Timetanium!	\nDifficultyTitanium-5	Emperor	Titanium	\n	AnalysisBot	The human made it!	\n	Commentatron	Now the real fun begins.	\nDifficultyTitanium-6	Emperor	Titanium	\n	AnalysisBot	Titanium!	\n	Commentatron	I love Titanium!	\nDifficultyTitanium-7	Emperor	Titanium	\n	AnalysisBot	You shoot me down, but I won't fall.	\n	Commentatron	Everyone falls in Titanium.	\nDifficultyTitanium-8	Emperor	Titanium!	\n	Commentatron	How far do you think the human will get?	\n	AnalysisBot	Not much further.	\nDifficultyTitanium-9	Emperor	Titanium!	\n	AnalysisBot	End of the line.	\nDifficultyUranium-1	Emperor	Uranium!	\n	Commentatron	Incredible!	\nDifficultyUranium-2	Emperor	Uranium!	\n	Commentatron	This human is still alive??	\n	AnalysisBot	Not for long.	\nDifficultyUranium-3	Emperor	Uranium!	\n	AnalysisBot	I like Uranium.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, it is fun to play with.	\nDifficultyUranium-4	AnalysisBot	Uranium!?	\n	Emperor	Hey!	\n	AnalysisBot	I did not see this coming.	\n	Commentatron	Keep up, Analysis-Bot!	\nDifficultyUranium-5	Emperor	Uranium!	\n	AnalysisBot	Commentatron!

Why?	\n	AnalysisBot	They play games where the viewer cannot interact with their game play instead.	\n	Commentatron	Whaaaaaat?	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps they do not realize their viewers would be earning danger coins by just watching the stream.	\n	Commentatron	Oh.	\n	AnalysisBot	And they would be betting those coins on game outcomes to earn more coins.	\n	Commentatron	But what can they do with so many coins?	\n	AnalysisBot	They can spawn enemies.	\n	AnalysisBot	They can troll players with emoticons.	\n	AnalysisBot	And maybe even spawn extra clones.	\n	Commentatron	How could all humans be so ignorant that they are not playing this game right now?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is not all humans. Many streamers are already playing Twitch mode.	\n	Commentatron	Like this one?	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	And this one?	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	What about this one, too? Is he having fun?	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	Well is it hard to use? Complicated to set up?	\n	AnalysisBot	No. All the humans must do is click this button, press play, and their viewers can interact.	\n	Commentatron	Clearly they do not have the information that they need.	\n	AnalysisBot	Humans, can you hear us?	\n	AnalysisBot	Interacting with Twitch mode is the optimal way to experience life.	\n	Commentatron	Before we incinerate your body, and harvest your mind.	\n	AnalysisBot	Death comes for us all.	\n	Commentatron	It is how you live your life that matters.	\n	AnalysisBot	Well at least for their short remainder.	\n	Commentatron	Twitch mode. Woo hoo.	\n	AnalysisBot	They will soon be harvested.	\n	Commentatron	Do it now.
