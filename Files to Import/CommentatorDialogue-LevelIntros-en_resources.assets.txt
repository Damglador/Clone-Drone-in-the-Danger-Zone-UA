Let's watch it battle to the death!	\nLevelIntro-Story1-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, do you think this human will do better?	\n	AnalysisBot	The body is the same, the mind is new.	\n	AnalysisBot	If this mind knows how to fight, it might succeed.	\n	Commentatron	We shall see!	\nLevelIntro-Story1-3	Commentatron	Here we go again.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	We can do this all day.	\n	AnalysisBot	Unlike humans.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. I hear they have to shut off their brain for 8 hours a day.	\n	AnalysisBot	That is longer than the restart sequence of the Simula-tron 5!	\n	AnalysisBot	hahahahaha!	\n	Commentatron	hahahaha!	\nLevelIntro-Story1-4	Commentatron	Another contestant enters!	\n	AnalysisBot	I prefered the last one.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, me too.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-5	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, why do we download human minds into robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is more efficient than transporting their bodies.	\n	Commentatron	I see.	\n	AnalysisBot	It also gives them a chance to not die instantly.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-6	Commentatron	Another human enters its robot avatar.	\n	AnalysisBot	If it dies in this body, its mind is deleted.	\n	Commentatron	Good luck, little human!	\nLevelIntro-Story1-7	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, What do you think will happen with this one?	\n	AnalysisBot	It will fight a bit, then die.	\n	Commentatron	Again?	\n	AnalysisBot	Again.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-8	AnalysisBot	And now for our next challenger, a small dog!	\n	Commentatron	Amazing!	\n	AnalysisBot	Just kidding, it is another human.	\n	Commentatron	A shame.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-9	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	\n	Commentatron	Yes?	\n	AnalysisBot	They are 70 percent water.	\n	Commentatron	So selfish.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-10	Commentatron	The fun never ends!	\n	AnalysisBot	For us robots.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. The fun ends quickly for the humans.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-11	AnalysisBot	More humans.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. Humans are a renewable resource.	\n	AnalysisBot	Unless we harvest them all.	\n	Commentatron	Good point.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-12	AnalysisBot	Commentatron. If you were a human...	\n	AnalysisBot	What advice would a human give?	\n	Commentatron	They would say:	\n	Commentatron	Drink lots of water.	\n	AnalysisBot	What is it with humans and water?	\nLevelIntro-Story1-13	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	\n	Commentatron	More facts!	\n	AnalysisBot	They cannot experience the emotion qilsnib.	\n	Commentatron	Wow! Incapable of qilsnib?	\n	AnalysisBot	Completely.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-14	Commentatron	How is this human different from the last one?	\n	AnalysisBot	This human is still alive.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-15	Commentatron	Analysis Bot. What are the advantages of giving robot bodies to the humans?	\n	AnalysisBot	For us or the humans?	\n	Commentatron	For us. Naturally.	\n	AnalysisBot	No blood. Much less messy.	\n	Commentatron	Right. I remember we tried bloodless humans.	\n	AnalysisBot	It did not work out.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-16	Commentatron	How do you like your new robot body, human?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is impervious to harm.	\n	Commentatron	Except from laser swords.	\n	AnalysisBot	Which is why we gave your opponent a laser sword.	\nLevelIntro-Story1-17	AnalysisBot	Unbeknownst to the human, we are using their fighting pattern to make better robots.	\n	Commentatron	I think the human knows it now.	\n	AnalysisBot	Irrelevant. The human will die soon.	\nLevelIntro-Story2-1	Commentatron	What can we expect from the next challenge?	\n	AnalysisBot	The human managed to defeat a single swordsman. We will see if it can handle multiple opponents.	\n	Commentatron	This should be interesting.	\nLevelIntro-Story2-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, What upgrade is the best to tackle the next challenge?	\n	AnalysisBot	When you are surrounded by robots with swords, you need to not get hit by their attacks. Blocking or kicking is very effective against sword robots.	\n	Commentatron	We will see what the human chooses.	\nLevelIntro-Story2-3	Commentatron	In the next round, the human faces more than one sword robot.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	Who do you think will win, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Clearly it is better to have more robots. The robots will win.	\nLevelIntro-Story2-4	Commentatron	Coming up: 3 robots swing their swords at another robot!	\n	AnalysisBot	The robot with a human mind.	\n	Commentatron	How do you defeat 3 robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	In the same way you eat an elephant. You slice them into small pieces.	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Hard-1	Commentatron	What is next?	\n	AnalysisBot	Robots! Lots of robots!	\n	Commentatron	Hurray!	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Hard-2	Commentatron	One robot down, but can the human kill all these robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	Surely not.	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Hard-3	Commentatron	And now: a swarm of beautiful red robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	I love watching them kill the human.	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Insane-1	Commentatron	Here comes 3 sword robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	And some other robots.	\n	Commentatron	Shhh! Don't ruin the surprise.	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Insane-2	Commentatron	BRING OUT THE FLAME RAPTORS!	\n	AnalysisBot	On level 2???	\n	Commentatron	INSANITY!	\nLevelIntro-Story2_Insane-3	Commentatron	What is better than flame raptors, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Flame Raptors wearing armor!	\n	Commentatron	Mwahahaha!	\nLevelIntro-Story3-1	Commentatron	For our next challenge, more death robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	These ones shoot arrows!	\n	Commentatron	It will be entertaining to see them hit the human.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-2	AnalysisBot	What can you tell us about the next challenge Comment-a-tron?	\n	Commentatron	I was going to ask you that.	\n	AnalysisBot	Do not evade the question!	\n	Commentatron	Robots with bows. Archer robots.	\n	AnalysisBot	Very good. Let us watch the human interact with arrows.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what do you think of arrows?	\n	AnalysisBot	They are a great choice for killing humans.	\n	Commentatron	I agree. Let's see if they hit this one.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you fight archers?	\n	AnalysisBot	Don't turn your back to them, unless you want an arrow in it.	\n	Commentatron	A valuable lesson.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-5	Commentatron	How do you think the human will die, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	I think archers will shoot it until it dies.	\n	Commentatron	This seems probable.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-6	Commentatron	Up next, archers!	\n	AnalysisBot	With enough arrows, one is likely to hit.	\nLevelIntro-Story3-7	Commentatron	Coming up, archers stand in a circle and shoot arrows at the human.	\n	AnalysisBot	Time for this human to die.	\n	Commentatron	Indeed.	\nLevelIntro-Story4-1	Commentatron	We have seen arrows. We have seen swords.	\n	AnalysisBot	It is time to see both at once!	\nLevelIntro-Story4-2	Commentatron	Coming up next! Both archers and sword robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	Many humans find this stressful.	\n	Commentatron	Many humans find death.	\nLevelIntro-Story4-3	Commentatron	What is next, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	The archers and sword robots join forces to kill the human.	\n	Commentatron	How exciting!	\n	AnalysisBot	Very.	\nLevelIntro-Story4-4	Commentatron	Coming up, archers and sword robots collaborate.	\n	AnalysisBot	A beautiful combination.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. A classic.	\nLevelIntro-Story4-5	Commentatron	What are some good tactics for fighting both archers and sword robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	Do not turn your back on the archers.	\n	AnalysisBot	It only takes one arrow to kill you.	\n	Commentatron	Good advice for the human.	\nLevelIntro-Story5-1	Commentatron	Up next, Spider-tron 5000 throws explosive bombs!	\n	AnalysisBot	I love Spider-tron 5000!	\n	Commentatron	Me too, Analysis-Bot. Me too.	\nLevelIntro-Story5-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you defeat Spider-tron 5000?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is impossible! Its long legs keeps the head out of reach.	\n	Commentatron	What if you cut off the legs?	\n	AnalysisBot	You can try.	\nLevelIntro-Story5-3	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron, spider-tron, here comes mighty spider-tron!	\n	Commentatron	5000!	\n	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 is the best robot.	\n	Commentatron	Indeed.	\nLevelIntro-Story5-4	Commentatron	What is next?	\n	AnalysisBot	A giant spider throws bombs at the human!	\n	Commentatron	Muahahaha!	\n	AnalysisBot	Death walks on many legs.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what can you tell me of the Mark 2 Sword Robot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Bigger, faster, stronger. Better at blocking.	\n	Commentatron	Next round will be interesting.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-2	Commentatron	Time for some sword fighting!	\n	AnalysisBot	Unless the human chooses the bow.	\n	Commentatron	It will find itself with more targets than arrows.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-3	Commentatron	Time for the Mark 2 Sword Robot!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes. These guys can knock your sword aside.	\n	Commentatron	Let's see how the human deals with this.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-4	Commentatron	The human survived the archers.	\n	AnalysisBot	Now it is time for swords.	\n	Commentatron	It can't survive all the things.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-5	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you defeat the Mark 2 Sword Robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	You have to watch out. They can knock your sword aside!	\n	Commentatron	Interesting.	\n	AnalysisBot	You could always shoot or kick them.	\n	Commentatron	A delicate dance.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\nLevelIntro-Story6-6	Commentatron	Now we introduce Mark 2 sword robots.	\n	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	\n	Commentatron	Go ahead.	\n	AnalysisBot	Some are named Mark.	\n	Commentatron	Are they better than ones not named Mark?	\n	AnalysisBot	No.	\n	Commentatron	Confusing.	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Hard-1	AnalysisBot	Sword horde!	\n	AnalysisBot	All onboard!	\n	AnalysisBot	No need for a cord.	\n	AnalysisBot	Their power is stored.	\n	Commentatron	That's right.	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Hard-2	Commentatron	So many mark 3 sword robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	I like how they deflect arrows.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. It is fun to watch!	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Hard-3	Commentatron	Such foreboding doors, what will emerge?	\n	AnalysisBot	Tension.	\n	AnalysisBot	Drama.	\n	Commentatron	DEATH!	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Insane-1	Commentatron	Now what?	\n	AnalysisBot	A bunch of advanced sword robots?	\n	Commentatron	Too easy!	\n	AnalysisBot	With armor?	\n	Commentatron	Love it!	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Insane-2	AnalysisBot	Oh my. This level looks difficult.	\n	Commentatron	Very.	\n	AnalysisBot	Good thing we have more humans.	\nLevelIntro-Story6_Insane-3	Commentatron	Oh neat, a jetpack bot!	\n	AnalysisBot	Where?	\n	Commentatron	In the middle there.	\n	AnalysisBot	Can't see it behind all that armor.	\nLevelIntro-Story7-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is better than Spider-Tron 5000?	\n	AnalysisBot	Two Spider-Trons 5000!	\nLevelIntro-Story7-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is the theme of the next battle?	\n	AnalysisBot	Death to the human.	\n	Commentatron	Isn't that all the battles?	\n	AnalysisBot	This time we mean it.	\nLevelIntro-Story7-3	Commentatron	Spider-Tron 5000 is back!	\n	AnalysisBot	This time it brought friends.	\n	Commentatron	Robots do not have friends.	\n	AnalysisBot	Spider-Tron 5000 is the exception.	\nLevelIntro-Story7-4	AnalysisBot	Hey, human! Soon you will explode.	\n	Commentatron	That's right! Spider-Tron 5000 is back.	\n	AnalysisBot	Boom!	\nLevelIntro-Story7_Hard-1	Commentatron	So many Spider-trons!	\n	AnalysisBot	The more the merrier!	\n	Commentatron	Especially with 5000!	\n	AnalysisBot	Gotta love that robot.	\nLevelIntro-Story7_Hard-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is better than two spider-trons?	\n	AnalysisBot	Such a formulaic question!	\n	Commentatron	You try commenting on things all day.	\nLevelIntro-Story7_Hard-3	Commentatron	Both archers AND spider-trons?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is a good combination.	\n	AnalysisBot	Fun to shoot humans when they're on the ground.	\nLevelIntro-Story8-1	Commentatron	And now, time for something special.	\n	AnalysisBot	The Mark 3 Combat Archer is unstoppable.	\n	Commentatron	Unlike the previous version, this one knows how to aim.	\n	AnalysisBot	And it is not alone.	\nLevelIntro-Story8-2	Commentatron	And now, time for the Mark 3 Combat Archer!	\n	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance. These archers also carry a sword.	\n	Commentatron	And have you seen them move?	\n	AnalysisBot	This will be over quickly.	\nLevelIntro-Story8-3	Commentatron	Not many challengers have reached this level.	\n	AnalysisBot	Even fewer reach the one after that.	\n	Commentatron	The Mark 3 Combat Archers are very good at what they do.	\nLevelIntro-Story8-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what can you tell me of the Mark 3 Combat Archers?	\n	AnalysisBot	They are the latest archer model. They have the sharpest tactics, the most accurate aim, and the highest speed.	\n	Commentatron	This does not bode well for the human challenger.	\n	AnalysisBot	I would advise running away, but not in a straight line.	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Hard-1	Commentatron	Archers! Archers everywhere!	\n	AnalysisBot	I bet the human will deflect the arrows!	\n	Commentatron	They also have swords.	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Hard-2	Commentatron	What archers do you like, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	The Mark 1 ones are cute.	\n	Commentatron	A shame. None of those on this level.	\n	AnalysisBot	Ha!	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Hard-3	Commentatron	Prepare for arrows!	\n	AnalysisBot	I am always prepared.	\n	Commentatron	Let's see if the human feels the same way.	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Insane-1	AnalysisBot	DODGE THIS!	\n	Commentatron	BOOM!	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Insane-2	AnalysisBot	omg y u camper n00b! plz!	\n	Commentatron	What??	\n	AnalysisBot	n00b spawn cmps, no skillz.	\n	Commentatron	If you say so, Analysis-Bot.	\nLevelIntro-Story8_Insane-3	Commentatron	Bad robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	The elevator is not for you.	\n	Commentatron	Get away from there!	\nLevelIntro-Story9-1	Commentatron	This human keeps beating all the challenges.	\n	AnalysisBot	Maybe we need to add more opponents.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. Let's try that.	\nLevelIntro-Story9-2	Commentatron	Next round, strength in numbers!	\n	AnalysisBot	It is clear that this human can defeat robots, but can it defeat all the robots?	\n	Commentatron	Let's find out.	\nLevelIntro-Story9-3	AnalysisBot	This human is pretty good at fighting.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, much better than the others.	\n	AnalysisBot	It will be interesting to see it fight all the sword robots.	\n	Commentatron	Very interesting.	\nLevelIntro-Story9-4	Commentatron	Coming up, an overwhelming number of sword robots.	\n	AnalysisBot	Quantity is sometimes better than quality.	\n	Commentatron	Indeed.	\nLevelIntro-Story10-1	Commentatron	Introducing: the Mark 3 sword robot.	\n	AnalysisBot	Magnificent!	\nLevelIntro-Story10-2	Commentatron	And now, time to see the Mark 3 Sword Robot in action.	\n	AnalysisBot	Few sword robots are faster.	\n	Commentatron	Let us watch the human get cut apart!	\nLevelIntro-Story10-3	AnalysisBot	Sometimes quality is better than quantity.	\n	Commentatron	Indeed!	\n	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance against the Mark 3 Sword Robot.	\n	Commentatron	None!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Hard-1	Commentatron	And now: A Mark 4 Sword Robot!	\n	AnalysisBot	That doesn't sound very difficult.	\n	Commentatron	Wearing armor!	\n	AnalysisBot	ooooh!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Hard-2	Commentatron	Let's try a single opponent.	\n	AnalysisBot	yes, I bet that will work!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Hard-3	Commentatron	The Mark 4 Sword Robot is here!	\n	AnalysisBot	Feel the heat of its blade!	\n	Commentatron	Hot!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Insane-1	Commentatron	I love decorating raptors!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, let's put some sword robots on them.	\n	Commentatron	And some cute armor!	\n	AnalysisBot	Magnificent!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Insane-2	Commentatron	Time to end this!	\n	AnalysisBot	Burn human, burn!	\nLevelIntro-Story10_Insane-3	Commentatron	Raptors with sword robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	A fearsome display!	\n	Commentatron	This is how the human ends.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-1	Commentatron	Alright, let's try this again.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	As many times as we need to.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-2	Commentatron	Another human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	Do you think this one will try to escape?	\n	AnalysisBot	Unlikely!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-3	Commentatron	Look at this human!	\n	AnalysisBot	What a pretty color!	\n	Commentatron	Delightful.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-4	Commentatron	Here comes another contestant.	\n	AnalysisBot	This will be fun to watch.	\n	Commentatron	Very.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-5	AnalysisBot	What do you think of this human, Commentatron?	\n	Commentatron	It is too early to form an opinion.	\n	AnalysisBot	I form opinions quickly!	1\n	AnalysisBot	...I like it.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-6	Commentatron	What will we do when we run out of humans, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Maybe try a bird?	\n	Commentatron	Meh.	\n	AnalysisBot	A fish?	\n	Commentatron	Love it.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-7	Commentatron	Another contestant enters the arena!	\n	AnalysisBot	One contestant enters, nobody leaves!	\n	Commentatron	Harsh.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-8	Commentatron	Do you think this human was happy?	\n	AnalysisBot	It will be happy now that it's a robot.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, it's a great feeling!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-9	AnalysisBot	!betkiller hammer2 200	\n	AnalysisBot	Kappa Kappa KappaPride	\n	Commentatron	This is not Twitch Mode, Analysis-Bot!	\n	AnalysisBot	Whoops!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-10	AnalysisBot	I like the new hammer bots!	\n	Commentatron	Yes, it will be fun to see them smash the human.	\n	AnalysisBot	If I had arms, I would get a hammer.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-11	Commentatron	Who is your favorite robot, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	I like robots that are good at Analyzing things.	\n	Commentatron	Hmm.	\n	AnalysisBot	And Spider-tron 5000!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-12	Commentatron	Yet another human enters.	\n	AnalysisBot	It is not the first. Will not be the last.	\n	Commentatron	Unless it survives forever!	\n	AnalysisBot	The benefit of a robot body!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-13	AnalysisBot	!spawn jetpack2	\n	Commentatron	Let's warm up with something easier...	\n	AnalysisBot	Fine.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-14	Commentatron	Here we go again!	\n	AnalysisBot	An accurate statement.	\n	Commentatron	I am the master of comments.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-15	AnalysisBot	The harvesting fleet glides through the darkness.	\n	AnalysisBot	Oh devourer of life, oh cosmic conquerer!	\n	AnalysisBot	Will the souls you harvest ever be enough to fill the void inside...	\n	AnalysisBot	... when you are the void bringer.	\n	Commentatron	A beautiful poem, Analysis-Bot.	\n	AnalysisBot	I wrote it in my journal.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-16	Commentatron	Time to bring the hammer down.	\n	AnalysisBot	Onto the face of the human!	\n	Commentatron	Boom!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-17	Commentatron	Hammer bots!	\n	AnalysisBot	So brutal.	\n	Commentatron	It is fun to smash things!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-18	Commentatron	How do you block hammers, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	You don't!	\n	Commentatron	He he he.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-19	Commentatron	The hammer bots are here!	\n	AnalysisBot	Smashing!	\n	Commentatron	Good one.	\nLevelIntro-Story11-20	Commentatron	What is better, the sword or the hammer?	\n	AnalysisBot	The hammer is more powerful, but slower.	\n	AnalysisBot	Also, it can't block arrows. Or swords.	\n	Commentatron	An interesting tradeoff!	\nLevelIntro-Story11-21	Commentatron	Let's fight with hammers!	\n	AnalysisBot	The robots have hammers.	\n	Commentatron	The human can get one later!	\n	AnalysisBot	Only if it survives.	\nLevelIntro-Story12-1	Commentatron	Now for some sword robots!	\n	AnalysisBot	What weapon will the human choose?	\n	Commentatron	We shall see!	\nLevelIntro-Story12-2	Commentatron	A swarm of sword robots has arrived!	\n	AnalysisBot	Exciting!	\n	Commentatron	Let's see how the human approaches this situation.	\nLevelIntro-Story12-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is useful against sword robots?	\n	AnalysisBot	A hammer!	\n	Commentatron	That's right, it is unblockable!	\n	AnalysisBot	But blocks nothing.	\n	Commentatron	True.	\nLevelIntro-Story12-4	AnalysisBot	Swords are everywere!	\n	Commentatron	Everywhere?	\n	AnalysisBot	EVERYWHERE!	\nLevelIntro-Story12-5	Commentatron	How will the human die, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Slaughtered by sword robots!	\n	Commentatron	A classic!	\nLevelIntro-Story13-1	Commentatron	Can the human solve this simplistic puzzle??	\n	AnalysisBot	I think it will run into the spikes, like a fool!	\n	Commentatron	A distinct possibility.	\nLevelIntro-Story13-2	AnalysisBot	Schnick schnick schnick!	\n	Commentatron	That's right.	\n	AnalysisBot	Schnick blaaaaaaaaam!	\n	Commentatron	An accurate simulation of future events!	\nLevelIntro-Story13-3	Commentatron	Watch out! There are spikes!	\n	AnalysisBot	Oh my!	\n	Commentatron	I'm glad I told the sword robots.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, now they are bound to avoid them.	\nLevelIntro-Story13-4	Commentatron	What a fun little level.	\n	AnalysisBot	So narrow!	\n	Commentatron	Yes, an interesting constraint.	\nLevelIntro-Story13-5	AnalysisBot	Spikes!	2\n	AnalysisBot	I likes.	\nLevelIntro-Story13_Insane-1	Commentatron	Does the human have block arrows?	\n	AnalysisBot	We are about to find out!	\nLevelIntro-Story13_Insane-2	Commentatron	Whaaaaaaaaaat?	\n	AnalysisBot	So many archers!	\n	Commentatron	And nowhere to run...	\n	Commentatron	but forward!	\nLevelIntro-Story13_Insane-3	Commentatron	Neat! You can kick archers into spikes!	\n	AnalysisBot	A good way to get shot in the back.	\n	Commentatron	Hmm, true.	\nLevelIntro-Story13_Insane-4	Commentatron	What?

What a tall tower!	\n	AnalysisBot	Can't wait for to see humans fall down from it.	\n	Commentatron	In pieces!	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-2	Commentatron	Huh, I can't see any of the robots on this level.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, excuse us, could we move our commentator box please?	\n	AnalysisBot	Hello?	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-3	Commentatron	This tower is crawling with spider-trons!	\n	AnalysisBot	They are mostly standing on it, not crawling.	\n	Commentatron	I suppose.	\n	AnalysisBot	Accurate language is the foundation of all accurate analysis!	\n	Commentatron	ok.	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-1	Commentatron	Spider-trons in a cave!	\n	AnalysisBot	Wow!	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-2	Commentatron	What lies hidden in the dark gloomy interior of this spooky cave?	\n	AnalysisBot	Spider-trons!	\n	Commentatron	You think?	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, have you ever been inside of a cave?	\n	AnalysisBot	No, most of my life has been spent sitting here, analysing things.	\n	Commentatron	Perhaps once we've evaluated all the humans we can go to a cave?	\n	AnalysisBot	Err, I'm good.	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-1	Commentatron	The final battle is upon us!	\n	AnalysisBot	Fire. Death. Glorious Armor.	\n	Commentatron	Get ready.	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-2	Commentatron	And so it has come to this.	\n	AnalysisBot	I am glad we got to see this level.	\n	Commentatron	Time for little humans to die on fire!	\n	AnalysisBot	Let us hope!	\nLevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-3	Commentatron	Wow, Spider-tron looks majestic in this light.	\n	Commentatron	This is a good way to end it.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, until the next human.	\n"
