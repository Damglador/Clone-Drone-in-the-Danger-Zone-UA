Go there.	\nReturnToElevator-4	Commentatron	So what have you been up to lately, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	I have been analysing humans.	\n	Commentatron	What is your conclusion?	\n	AnalysisBot	This one does not seem very bright.	\n	Commentatron	Perhaps the next one will be better.	\nReturnToElevator-5	Commentatron	Perhaps the human thinks we will get bored.	\n	AnalysisBot	It is mistaken. We have rich inner lives.	\n	Commentatron	Yes. Very rich.	\nReturnToElevator-6	Commentatron	Hmm, perhaps this human does not speak English...	\n	HelpVoice	One moment please.	1\n	HelpVoice	Humana, por favor regrese al ascensor !	0.5\n	HelpVoice	al'iinsan, yrja aleawdat 'iilaa almuseid !	0.5\n	HelpVoice	Rén, qǐng fǎnhuí diàntī!	0.5\n	HelpVoice	Människa, gå tillbaka till hissen !	\n	Commentatron	Thank you disembodied announcer voice.	\nReturnToElevator-7	Commentatron	Human want a treat?	\n	AnalysisBot	Tasty treat for human?	\n	Commentatron	Go to the elevator!	\n	AnalysisBot	There is a fun treat in the elevator!	\nReturnToElevator-8	AnalysisBot	Hey! Human! Go back to the elevator.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-1	Commentatron	The human tried to enter the garbage room.	\n	AnalysisBot	Very strange.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-2	Commentatron	Why is the human throwing itself at the garbage room forcefield?	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it wants to dig through the garbage?	\n	Commentatron	Disgusting!	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-3	AnalysisBot	Bad human!	\n	Commentatron	That room is not for you!	\n	AnalysisBot	Look at the elevator behind you.	\n	Commentatron	That is where you should go.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, why do you think this human likes garbage so much?	\n	AnalysisBot	The technology of humans is inferior to ours.	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps garbage reminds it of home.	\n	Commentatron	That makes sense.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-5	AnalysisBot	I like this forcefield.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, it is pleasant to see the human fly.	\n	AnalysisBot	What a silly human.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-6	Commentatron	Maybe we should kill this human. That way it would be allowed into the garbage room.	\n	AnalysisBot	You make a compelling argument.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-7	AnalysisBot	Access denied, human.	\n	Commentatron	The garbage room is only for garbage robots.	\n	AnalysisBot	And garbage.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-8	Commentatron	Perhaps the human is confused.	\n	AnalysisBot	Human, you are not garbage!	\n	Commentatron	Not yet.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-9	Commentatron	Come on human, go to the elevator!	\n	AnalysisBot	The next round you can enter the garbage room in pieces.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-10	Commentatron	Remember: Recycling is very important.	\n	AnalysisBot	Recycling is the optimal use of matter.	\n	Commentatron	Only a fool would not recycle.	\n	AnalysisBot	Do not be a fool.	\nRepulsedByGarbageForceField-11	Commentatron	This human is boring.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	After it dies, let's pick an interesting human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps someone less fascinated by garbage.	\nPlayerKilledClone-1	Commentatron	This is unexpected!	\n	AnalysisBot	The human killed its clone.	\n	Commentatron	What a strange human.	\nPlayerKilledClone-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, Why would the human kill its clone?	\n	AnalysisBot	Since the human killed its clone, we must assume that the clone was planning the same thing.	\n	Commentatron	The mind boggles!	\nPlayerKilledClone-3	Commentatron	Oh dear.	\n	AnalysisBot	That is not the optimal way to win this game.	\nPlayerKilledClone-4	Commentatron	Do you think the human understands that these robots are clones of it?	\n	AnalysisBot	Apparently not.	\n	Commentatron	Hopefully the next human will be brighter.	\nPlayerKilledClone-5	Commentatron	The human is killing its clones!	\n	AnalysisBot	What a rebellious act of defiance!	\n	Commentatron	It is a pointless gesture. There is only one way out of that room.	\nPlayerKilledClone-6	Commentatron	Oh dear, this human is having some sort of mental breakdown.	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it will carry this murderous energy onto the floor of the arena!	\n	Commentatron	Let's hope so.	\nPlayerKilledClone-7	Commentatron	Hmmm. The human is killing its clones.	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it thinks all robots look the same.	\n	Commentatron	I suppose there are no outward signs that these carry a copy of its consciousness.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-1	Commentatron	The human made a clone!	\n	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how are new humans created?	\n	AnalysisBot	I am told that they are grown inside other humans.	\n	Commentatron	Ewww!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-3	AnalysisBot	Now the human has a friend!	\n	Commentatron	It is only friends with copies of itself.	\n	AnalysisBot	It is the human way.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-4	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, did you know that most humans have no clone backups?	\n	Commentatron	What about "twins"?	\n	AnalysisBot	They don't act as replacements when one of them dies.	\n	Commentatron	Then what are they good for?	\n	AnalysisBot	I'm not sure.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-5	Commentatron	Good, the human has a backup.	\n	AnalysisBot	You should always make a backup.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-6	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how long does it take to create a human?	\n	AnalysisBot	About 9 months to create the first version, then several years to teach it how to do things.	\n	Commentatron	So long!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-7	Commentatron	Nice. Now more versions of this human will die.	\n	AnalysisBot	Perhaps they will die in different ways!	\n	Commentatron	We shall see!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-8	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, do you have any clones?	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes. But I am the best version.	\n	Commentatron	Me too.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-9	Commentatron	A clone!	\n	AnalysisBot	Great!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-10	Commentatron	It appears this human fears death.	\n	AnalysisBot	Typical.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-11	Commentatron	You make Upgrade Bot sad.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-12	AnalysisBot	Here is your clone, human!	\n	Commentatron	We even painted it your favorite color!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-13	Commentatron	Oh. the human chose to make a clone.	\n	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for sword upgrades.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-14	Commentatron	The clone option!	\n	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for bow upgrades.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-15	Commentatron	A clone!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	A clone drone!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	A clone drone in the danger arena!	\n	AnalysisBot	Perfect!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-16	Commentatron	Great. More garbage for the garbage bots.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-17	Commentatron	A prudent choice.	\n	AnalysisBot	Always with the prudent choices, these humans.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-18	Commentatron	You are privileged human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Normally backups take hours.	\n	Commentatron	We were clever and guessed you didn't want to die!	\nPlayerCreatedClone-19	AnalysisBot	Oh. More of them.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-20	AnalysisBot	I hope these clones are to your satisfaction human.	\n	Commentatron	If they are not we will fix them.	1\n	Commentatron	For the next human.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-21	AnalysisBot	I should've guessed the human would make more clones.	\n	Commentatron	Why is that Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	Making more of themselves.	1\n	AnalysisBot	Is their quote unquote thing.	\nPlayerCreatedClone-22	Commentatron	Hey human!	\n	Commentatron	Instead of creating clones.	\n	Commentatron	Why not create...	1\n	Commentatron	More skill?	\n	AnalysisBot	Good one Commentatron.	\nPostVictoryViolence-atlai	Commentatron	Hey human!	\n	Commentatron	Those are dead.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes. Go to the elevator.	\n	Commentatron	We will provide not dead ones soon!	\nCloneRepulsedByElevator-1	Commentatron	You think you are clever human?	\n	AnalysisBot	Many humans have tried this trick.	\nCloneRepulsedByElevator-2	AnalysisBot	Delete your account, human!	\n	Commentatron	It will be deleted when the human dies.	\nCloneRepulsedByElevator-3	Commentatron	Boom!	\n	AnalysisBot	That's right.	\n	Commentatron	Access DENIED!	\nCloneRepulsedByElevator-4	Commentatron	What a cowardly human!	\n	AnalysisBot	It tried to send its clone up to die.	\n	Commentatron	Terrible.	\nCloneRepulsedByElevator-5	Commentatron	This is why this arena is still in alpha.	\n	AnalysisBot	Stop discovering edge cases, human!	\nSpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-1	Commentatron	Look at that! Spider-trons are immune to saw blades!	\n	AnalysisBot	So strong! So handsome!	\nSpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-2	AnalysisBot	Ha! A saw blade poked Spider-Tron!	\n	Commentatron	It is no use. Its limbs can not be dented with such a simple tool.	\n	AnalysisBot	Unlike the human's robot!	\n	Commentatron	Muahaha.	\nSpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-3	Commentatron	In a dramatic twist, Spider-Tron fell among the saw blades.	\n	AnalysisBot	Laughable! It is immune to saw blades.	\n	Commentatron	Amusing.	\nSpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-4	Commentatron	When Spider-Tron walks on the saw blades, the saw blades get cut.	\n	AnalysisBot	ha ha ha!	\nRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-1	Commentatron	Ewww! The human jumped at us!	\n	AnalysisBot	Go away!	\nRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-2	Commentatron	Hello, human!	\nRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-3	Commentatron	What a silly human.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\nRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-4	Commentatron	Ha! You think we did not forsee this turn of events?	\n	AnalysisBot	You underestimate us, human!	\nRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-5	AnalysisBot	No no no!	\n	Commentatron	It's ok Analysis-Bot, the human can't get us here.	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-1	Commentatron	How dare you!	\n	AnalysisBot	Get away from the Emperor, human!	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-2	Emperor	Fool.	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-3	Emperor	Enjoy your last moments, fool.	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-4	Commentatron	The emperor is not so easily provoked.	\n	AnalysisBot	Fly away, little human.	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-5	Emperor	Look at it struggle.	\n	Emperor	Pathetic!	\nRepulsedByEmperorForceField-6	Commentatron	Look! The human is exploring.	\n	AnalysisBot	Cute.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-1	AnalysisBot	They all try this!	\n	Commentatron	Do they not enjoy our delightful commentary?	\n	AnalysisBot	Probably a mistake.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-2	AnalysisBot	Aaaah!	\n	Commentatron	It's ok!	\n	AnalysisBot	The arrows startled me.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-3	Commentatron	The human shot us!	\n	AnalysisBot	Really mature human, this one!	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-4	Commentatron	That tickled!	\n	AnalysisBot	Commentatron!	\n	AnalysisBot	You did not tell me you had a somatosensory system installed!	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-5	Commentatron	What a wasted arrow!	\n	AnalysisBot	Like the human's wasted life.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-6	Commentatron	You missed, human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Or did it?	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-7	AnalysisBot	Suicide by forcefield!	\n	Commentatron	A bad way to go.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-8	AnalysisBot	A futile arrow makes its way onto our forcefield.	\n	AnalysisBot	A symbol of the human's pointless struggle.	\n	AnalysisBot	Its inevitable death at the hands of overwhelming force.	\n	Commentatron	Anytime now.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-9	Commentatron	Hah!	\n	AnalysisBot	Nice arrow there.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-10	AnalysisBot	Oh no!	\n	Commentatron	What?	\n	AnalysisBot	I wanted to keep the arrow!	\n	Commentatron	We'll get you another one.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-11	AnalysisBot	FORCEFIELD ACTIVATE!!!	\n	Commentatron	It's automatic you know.	\n	AnalysisBot	I just like saying it.	\nArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-12	Commentatron	How many arrows is that now?	\n	AnalysisBot	I don't track that.	\n	Commentatron	I can see why.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-1	Emperor	Pathetic!	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-2	Emperor	Fool!	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-3	Emperor	Not today.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-4	Emperor	Hah!	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-5	Emperor	No thank you.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-6	Emperor	Die.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-7	Emperor	There is no hope.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-8	Emperor	Behold!	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-9	Emperor	Denied.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-10	Emperor	Bad human.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-11	Emperor	Next human, please.	\nArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-12	Emperor	The human's desperation is most entertaining.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-1	Commentatron	Excellent choice!	\n	AnalysisBot	Upgrade-Bot knows what it's doing.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-2	Commentatron	Interesting.	\n	AnalysisBot	There is a strategy at work here.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-3	Commentatron	Hurray for Upgrade-Bot!	\n	AnalysisBot	You can do it!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-4	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot! Upgrade Bot!	\n	AnalysisBot	The best bot is Upgrade Bot!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-5	Commentatron	Is that the option you would have chosen, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	At this stage? Yes.	\n	Commentatron	Hmm.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-6	Commentatron	I love watching Upgrade Bot work.	\n	AnalysisBot	Me too.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-7	Emperor	Magnificent work, Upgrade Bot!	\n	Emperor	Your service does not go unnoticed.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-8	Commentatron	Nice.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-9	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot is such a pro.	\n	AnalysisBot	Maybe we should let it choose upgrades all the time?	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-10	Commentatron	What!?	\n	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is playing a long game.	\n	Commentatron	I guess we'll see.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-11	Commentatron	I like this choice.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, not bad.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-12	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot has come a long way since its construction!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	It might run the place one day.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-13	AnalysisBot	I wish Upgrade Bot would upgrade me!	\n	Commentatron	Maybe once all the humans have died.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yay!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-14	Commentatron	Another solid choice.	\n	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot does not mess around.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-15	Commentatron	Don't you dare die, human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is very happy right now!	\n	Commentatron	We're watching you!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-16	AnalysisBot	An excellent choice!	\n	Commentatron	Yes.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-17	AnalysisBot	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!	\n	AnalysisBot	Go Upgrade Bot!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-18	Commentatron	What will it choose next!?	\n	AnalysisBot	It has a plan. I'm starting to see it.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-19	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot has the best arms!	\n	AnalysisBot	If I ever get arms they will be like Upgrade Bot's.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-20	Commentatron	Good choice.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-21	Commentatron	Hmm.	\n	AnalysisBot	You'll see!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-22	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	\n	Commentatron	Let's see what the human does with it.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-23	Commentatron	How long can Upgrade Bot keep this up?	\n	AnalysisBot	Until there are no more upgrades!	\n	Commentatron	We must make more upgrades!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-24	Commentatron	Oh dear.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes I'm not sure about that one...	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-25	Commentatron	Keep going Upgrade Bot!	\n	AnalysisBot	You can do it!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-26	Commentatron	Will this keep the human alive?	\n	AnalysisBot	If it doesn't I blame the human.	\n	Commentatron	Yes, Upgrade Bot is doing a good job.	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-27	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot, can I have a jetpack?	\n	Commentatron	Not now Analysis-Bot. It is busy upgrading the human.	\n	AnalysisBot	ok maybe later...	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-28	Commentatron	Another upgrade snaps into place!	\n	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is the best!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-29	Commentatron	Oho!	\n	AnalysisBot	This will be useful!	\nUpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-30	AnalysisBot	What if we had two upgrade bots?	\n	AnalysisBot	They could upgrade eachother.	\n	Commentatron	That is dangerous talk, Analysis-Bot...	\n	Commentatron	It may sound tempting, but the rules are there for a reason.	\nWarCubes-1	WarCubes	Hello!	\n	WarCubes	Hello human!	\n	WarCubes	We are Warcubes!	\n	Commentatron	What is going on here??	\n	AnalysisBot	I have no idea.	\n	WarCubes	Easter-bot 4000 trapped us in this room.	\n	WarCubes	Thank you for freeing us!	\n	WarCubes	We will never forget you.	\nWarCubesDestroyed-1	Commentatron	ok, that was pretty strange.	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes.	\n	Commentatron	I didn't even know Easter-Bot 4000 was back in the city.	\n	AnalysisBot	It came in with the last update.	\n	Commentatron	Weird robot.	\n	AnalysisBot	Very.	\nCheerAward_Clone-1	Cheering100Bit	Clone!	\nCheerAward_Armor-1	Cheering100Bit	Armor!	\nCheerAward_UpgradePoint-1	Cheering100Bit	Upgrade Point!	\nCheerAward_Ally-1	Cheering100Bit	Alleye!	\nTooManyCheerBots-1	Commentatron	So many cheer bots!	\n	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	\n	Commentatron	Let's spawn the remaining ones next round.	\n	AnalysisBot	Sounds good.	\nTooManyCheerBots-2	HelpVoice	Maximum cheer bots spawned. Delaying.	\n	Commentatron	Great. They will spawn in the next round.	\n	AnalysisBot	Such happy robots!	\nTooManyCheerBots-3	Commentatron	Wow, such generous spectators!	\n	AnalysisBot	Extremely!	\n	Commentatron	We will spawn the rest of the cheer bots next round.	\n	AnalysisBot	Perfect.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-1	Commentatron	A spawn camping human!	\n	AnalysisBot	Eww!	\n	Commentatron	Not cool.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Get away, human!	\n	Commentatron	Don't interrupt the other human.	\n	AnalysisBot	It is busy.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-3	Commentatron	How embarassing!	\n	AnalysisBot	Very.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-4	AnalysisBot	O M G! A spawn camper!	\n	Commentatron	Such tacky humans.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-5	HelpVoice	Invalid location.	\n	HelpVoice	Spawn camping not allowed.	\n	Commentatron	That's right.	\nSpawnCamperRepulsed-6	AnalysisBot	It was all a test!	\n	Commentatron	Yes, and this human failed.	\n	AnalysisBot	We shall see who fails to survive the coming battle.	\nSpawnCampArrowRepulsed-1	Commentatron	Deflected!	\n	AnalysisBot	Boom!	\n	Commentatron	Don't shoot arrows at humans who are spawning.	\n	AnalysisBot	Rude.	\nSpawnCampArrowRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Ping.	\n	Commentatron	Pong.	\n	AnalysisBot	Arrow deflection, all day long.	\nSpawnCampArrowRepulsed-3	HelpVoice	Arrow detected in spawn area.	\n	Commentatron	How did it get there??	\n	AnalysisBot	Troubling.	\nSpawnCampArrowRepulsed-4	Commentatron	Look! The human tried to shoot the spawning human!	\n	AnalysisBot	An outrage!	\n	Commentatron	Yes.	\nSpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-1	Commentatron	Too hot!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	Don't try to set the spawning human on fire, human!	\nSpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Creative!	\n	Commentatron	Yes.	\n	AnalysisBot	This human gets a creativity point.	\n	Commentatron	Also a deflection of their flames.	\n	AnalysisBot	Naturally.	\nSpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-3	Commentatron	That's one way to spawn camp.	\n	AnalysisBot	But not the right way.	\n	Commentatron	No. There is no such way.	\nSpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-4	HelpVoice	Irregular temperature in spawn area.	\n	HelpVoice	Shield activated.	\n	Commentatron	Good.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-1	Commentatron	Sliced!	\n	AnalysisBot	Beautiful!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-2	Commentatron	Good use of energy sword!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, this human used it correctly.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-3	AnalysisBot	BOOM!	\n	Commentatron	I bet this human enjoys being inside a sword robot!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, the swords are the best part.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-4	Commentatron	Live by the sword, die by the sword.	\n	AnalysisBot	Repeatedly.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-5	Commentatron	Nice!	\n	AnalysisBot	Slice!	\n	Commentatron	Pay the price.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-6	Commentatron	The human fell apart.	\n	AnalysisBot	New body, please!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-7	Commentatron	Ouch! That looked painful.	\n	AnalysisBot	At least the human was in a shiny robot body.	\n	Commentatron	Robot bodies are the best!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-8	Commentatron	I love the sound of energy swords!	\n	AnalysisBot	I prefer the sound of metal hitting the ground.	\n	Commentatron	Let's listen to more humans die!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-9	Commentatron	A sword kill!	\n	AnalysisBot	How ordinary.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-10	Commentatron	There it is.	\n	Commentatron	The sudden stillness.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-11	AnalysisBot	Behold, the human robot falls!	\n	Commentatron	Cut down.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-12	AnalysisBot	YEAH!	\n	AnalysisBot	THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!	1\n	Commentatron	...what are you talking about?	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-13	AnalysisBot	Stay down, human!	\n	Commentatron	It will be difficult.	\n	Commentatron	We keep putting the them in new bodies.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-14	Commentatron	Oh human!	\n	AnalysisBot	ugh.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-15	Commentatron	A solid sword kill.	\n	AnalysisBot	Pretty good.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Sword-16	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for a bow kill!	\n	Commentatron	Maybe next time.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-1	Commentatron	Hammer!	\n	AnalysisBot	Time!	\n	Commentatron	Time for Hammer!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-2	AnalysisBot	BOOM!	\n	Commentatron	Ooooooooooooooffff!	\n	AnalysisBot	So satisfying!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-3	AnalysisBot	Hammered!	\n	Commentatron	Whammered!	\n	AnalysisBot	Thank you mammal.	\n	Commentatron	What??	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-4	Commentatron	OUCH!	\n	Commentatron	DID YOU SEE THAT?	\n	AnalysisBot	Brutal.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-5	Commentatron	Shattered!	\n	AnalysisBot	No coming back from that.	\n	Commentatron	Unless you have a new body.	\n	AnalysisBot	Spoiler alert!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-6	Commentatron	I love watching the hammer collide with things!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes!	\n	Commentatron	WHACK!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-7	Commentatron	What time is it?	\n	AnalysisBot	...didn't we do this joke already?	\n	Commentatron	WE DID!?	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-8	Commentatron	Look at all those body parts!	\n	AnalysisBot	What a mess!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-9	AnalysisBot	CRACK!	\n	AnalysisBot	BRACK!	\n	AnalysisBot	BACKAFRACK!	\n	Commentatron	That is the sound a hammer makes.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-10	Commentatron	Squashed like a bug!	\n	AnalysisBot	A very large bipedal bug.	\n	Commentatron	The best kind!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-11	Commentatron	Nice hammer kill.	\n	AnalysisBot	Quite.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-1	AnalysisBot	Oh dear!	\n	Commentatron	It was a spear.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-2	Commentatron	Solid spear kill!	\n	AnalysisBot	Yes, very precise.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-3	Commentatron	What's that I hear?	\n	AnalysisBot	A spear?	\n	Commentatron	You know it.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-4	Commentatron	Spear spear spear!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-5	Commentatron	One body down.	\n	AnalysisBot	More to be speared.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-6	Commentatron	What do you think of the spear, Analysis-Bot?	\n	AnalysisBot	It is superior to normal sticks.	\n	Commentatron	I agree.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-7	AnalysisBot	POKE OF DEATH!	\n	AnalysisBot	DEATH POKE!	\n	Commentatron	This is entertainment.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-8	Emperor	What is the point? The spear is the point!	\n	AnalysisBot	Ha. Ha. Haaaaaaaa.	\n	Commentatron	Ha! Ha! What an entertaining joke, Emperor.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-9	Commentatron	And there it is.	\n	Commentatron	The spear retracts as the human falls to the ground.	\n	Commentatron	Garbage.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-10	AnalysisBot	Brutal spear kill!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-11	Commentatron	Ouch!	\n	AnalysisBot	Quite.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-12	AnalysisBot	What a fierce piercing!	\n	Commentatron	A fab stab.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Spear-13	Commentatron	Oh! That did it!	\n	AnalysisBot	Seems the human can't function without that body part.	\n	Commentatron	Makes sense.	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Arrow-1	Commentatron	Arrowed!	\n	AnalysisBot	Nice!	\nKilledByDamage1v1_Arrow-2	Commentatron	Nice shot!	\n	AnalysisBot	This is a promising
