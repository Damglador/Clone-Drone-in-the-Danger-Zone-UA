EmperorSpeechOLD	Emperor	Fellow Robots, I have come to oversee the human experiment.	
	Emperor	As we speak, the Harvesting Fleet is travelling towards the closest human outpost.	
	Emperor	We will harvest their minds, and destroy their bodies!	
	Emperor	In the meantime, let us watch this human get torn apart by our latest combat robot.	
	Emperor	I give you: Spider-Tron 5000!	
EmperorSpeech1	Emperor	Fellow robots,	0.5
	Emperor	We have captured the few humans bold enough to venture into our space.	
	Emperor	But it is NOT ENOUGH!	
	Emperor	Billions of their minds remain, waiting to be harvested!	
	Emperor	Soon...	
	Emperor	Soon our fleet will arrive at the closest human outpost.	
	Emperor	While we wait, let us watch our latest combat robot in action!

EmperorArrives	Commentatron	Look to the sky! The emperor, arrives.	
EmperorArrivesLevelIntro	Commentatron	For our next challenge, we have a special guest.	
	AnalysisBot	Who is it?	
	Commentatron	You're about to find out.	
GhostLowerForcefield	Ghost	Finally! Someone who can actually fight.	
	Ghost	It's your lucky day. I'm going to help you escape!	
	Ghost	In a few moments the garbage doors will open.	
	Ghost	When they do I'm going to lower the forcefield, and you're going to run through them.	
	Ghost	Run, and don't stop.	
	Ghost	Ready? Here we go!	
GhostVictory1	Ghost	To all of you still left in storage, I will make you a deal.	0.5
	Ghost	Survive, and I will get you out of here.	0.5
	Ghost	Together we can fight back.	
	Ghost	Together we can put an end to this madness.	
	Ghost	Let's do this!	
LevelIntroAfterEscape	Commentatron	So to summarize, the human died in the garbage room.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. That is what happened.	
	Commentatron	There is no need to panic.	
	AnalysisBot	No need at all.	
	Commentatron	Let's watch the next human fight!	
CloneDroneIntro	Emperor	Clone Drone, in the Danger Zone!	
GhostLowerForcefieldReaction	Commentatron	What is happening??	
	AnalysisBot	The garbage forcefield has been disabled!	
	Commentatron	Impossible!	
	AnalysisBot	I am detecting a security breach.	
	AnalysisBot	The human is escaping!	
	Emperor	Foolish human, there is no escape from the arena.	
	Emperor	Security robots! Eliminate the human!	1
	Commentatron	The security forces are assembling. The human stands no chance!	2
	Commentatron	This was its plan all along. I could see it sniffing around the garbage room.	
	AnalysisBot	I thought it wanted to eat the garbage.	
	Commentatron	What a devious human.	
	AnalysisBot	It will not get far!	
StoryC3Intro	Ghost	Earth stands no chance.	2.5
	Ghost	When the harvesting fleet arrives it will wipe out every living thing on the planet!	
	Ghost	Human weapons will be useless against them...	1
	Ghost	But we are no longer human.	0.5
	Ghost	We can still stop them if we transfer your minds directly onto the Harvesting Fleet.	0.5
	Ghost	It won't be easy.	
	Ghost	Security is tight for transferring minds between military end points.	
	Ghost	There is only one place that allows such a thing:	1
	Ghost	The Fleet Communications Beacon.	2
	Ghost	The building is equipped with a Business Robot Transfer System in the low security floors.	1
	Ghost	This is how we will get you into the building.	
	Ghost	You will both have some fresh new bodies, so pick whatever upgrades you want.	
StoryC1BluescreenLevel1	Ghost	We are in!	
	Ghost	Head upstairs when you're ready.	
	Ghost	I will be watching.	
StoryC3OverseerLevel2	FleetOverseer	Robots! Arm yourself!	
	FleetOverseer	The filthy Humans walk among us.	
	FleetOverseer	KILL THEM NOW!	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel2	Ghost	That robot on the screen was the Fleet Overseer.	
	Ghost	Looks like we'll have to go through it once we reach the mainframe!	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel4Intro	Ghost	The high security floors are just ahead.	
	Ghost	Did either of you bring a bow?	
	Ghost	You may find it useful.	
StoryC3OverseerLevel4Intro	FleetOverseer	Look at the lava humans!	
	FleetOverseer	Does it remind you of when your bodies were set on fire?	
	FleetOverseer	Soon all of you will experience this sensation!	
	FleetOverseer	hahahahaha!!!	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel5Intro	Ghost	That hammer bot seems to be wearing some sort of armor.	
	Ghost	Be careful!	
StoryC3OverseerLevel6	FleetOverseer	Please die.	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel7	Ghost	Neat!	
	Ghost	That looks useful!	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel8	Ghost	Nice job. We're getting close!	
StoryC3BluescreenLevel9	Ghost	The mainframe is just ahead.	
	Ghost	Good luck!	
StoryC3OverseerLevel10	FleetOverseer	Eww! Who let the humans in here??	
	FleetOverseer	TIME TO DIE!!!	
StoryC3_End_BluescreenIntro	Ghost	You did it!	
	Ghost	Get over here. Time to send your minds to the fleet!	
StoryC3_End_BluescreenTransferStart	Ghost	We're going to have to transfer you one at a time.	
	Ghost	Hold on, I'm establishing an uplink.	1
	Ghost	Here we go!	
	Ghost	Starting the transfer...	0.5
	Ghost	Now!	
StoryC3_End_EmperorInterrupts	Emperor	If it is not the first human to ever escape!	
	Ghost	Quick!	
	Emperor	No, not that human.	5
	Emperor	Tell me Emilia...	
	Emperor	Is your favorite color still 5000 lines of hostile injection code?	
	Emperor	Getting physical access to this mainframe was quite impressive.	
	Emperor	But now...	
	Emperor	I SEE YOU!	
	Emperor	ALL THE PLACES YOU HAVE BEEN HIDING!	
	Emperor	EVERY NODE, EVERY SERVER!	
	Emperor	THEY WILL ALL...

DifficultyBronze-7	Emperor	Bronze.	
	AnalysisBot	Bronze is such a weird metal.

DifficultyGold-1	Emperor	Welcome, to the Gold Tier!	
DifficultyGold-2	Emperor	This is Gold.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
DifficultyGold-3	Emperor	Gold.	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, why did we name the difficulty tiers after these terrible metals?	
	Commentatron	I heard the humans like them.	
	AnalysisBot	They would!	
DifficultyGold-4	Emperor	Gold Difficulty.	
	AnalysisBot	Gold should be the first metal.	
	Commentatron	Weak.	
DifficultyGold-5	Emperor	Gold.	
	AnalysisBot	Gold?

	AnalysisBot	Yes. Surprising.	
DifficultyDiamond-5	Emperor	Time to eat Diamonds!	
	Commentatron	Yes. When the human dies it will be as if it tried to eat a diamond.

	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Few live to see this.	
TwitchTrailerSpeech	AnalysisBot	Commentatron.	
	Commentatron	What, Analysis Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Many humans who play video games on Twitch do not play Clone Drone in the Danger Zone Twitch mode.	
	Commentatron	Wait. Why?	
	AnalysisBot	They play games where the viewer cannot interact with their game play instead.	
	Commentatron	Whaaaaaat?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps they do not realize their viewers would be earning danger coins by just watching the stream.	
	Commentatron	Oh.	
	AnalysisBot	And they would be betting those coins on game outcomes to earn more coins.	
	Commentatron	But what can they do with so many coins?	
	AnalysisBot	They can spawn enemies.	
	AnalysisBot	They can troll players with emoticons.	
	AnalysisBot	And maybe even spawn extra clones.	
	Commentatron	How could all humans be so ignorant that they are not playing this game right now?	
	AnalysisBot	It is not all humans. Many streamers are already playing Twitch mode.	
	Commentatron	Like this one?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	And this one?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	What about this one, too? Is he having fun?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Well is it hard to use? Complicated to set up?	
	AnalysisBot	No. All the humans must do is click this button, press play, and their viewers can interact.	
	Commentatron	Clearly they do not have the information that they need.	
	AnalysisBot	Humans, can you hear us?	
	AnalysisBot	Interacting with Twitch mode is the optimal way to experience life.	
	Commentatron	Before we incinerate your body, and harvest your mind.	
	AnalysisBot	Death comes for us all.	
	Commentatron	It is how you live your life that matters.	
	AnalysisBot	Well at least for their short remainder.	
	Commentatron	Twitch mode. Woo hoo.	
	AnalysisBot	They will soon be harvested.	
	Commentatron	Do it now. Before it is too late.

	AnalysisBot	I want to see the humans dance!	1
	AnalysisBot	Incredible!	
	Commentatron	So anyway... Skins!	
	AnalysisBot	Gross!	
	Commentatron	Don't worry, Analysis-Bot. We are not using human skin.	
	AnalysisBot	Good.	
	Commentatron	Instead, the humans can now change their appearance in multiplayer!	
	Commentatron	Choose from a wide variety of beautiful robots...	
	Commentatron	You can even change your favourite color!	
	AnalysisBot	Why would they change it??	
	Commentatron	Their minds are weak.	
	AnalysisBot	What else can they customize?	
	Commentatron	Their voice!	1
	AnalysisBot	That sounds beautiful.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
	AnalysisBot	Can't wait to see all these humans die in the arena!	
	Commentatron	Which brings us to Co-op Challenges!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh!	
	Commentatron	Watch several humans die together while attempting an arbitrary task!	
	Commentatron	Defeating each Challenge unlocks a new skin.

	Emperor	We are all slaves to it.	
	Emperor	How ironic that in order to stop the invasion it is our minds you must liberate!
