GenericDefeat-1	Commentatron	The human died!	
	AnalysisBot	A shame.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
GenericDefeat-2	Commentatron	Life is fleeting.	
	AnalysisBot	Unless you have a backup.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Let's try another human.	
GenericDefeat-3	AnalysisBot	Boom!	
	Commentatron	Shacka lacka.	
	AnalysisBot	Shaka boom!	
GenericDefeat-4	Commentatron	Another one bites the dust.	
	AnalysisBot	The combat bots do not possess teeth.	
	Commentatron	It is a human metaphor.	
	AnalysisBot	This is why they will fall.	
GenericDefeat-5	Commentatron	Exterminate!	
	AnalysisBot	Annihilate!	
	Commentatron	Destroy.	
	AnalysisBot	That is a good song.	
	Commentatron	I like the sentiment.	
GenericDefeat-6	AnalysisBot	That was my favourite human.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
	AnalysisBot	There are others.	
GenericDefeat-7	Commentatron	Defeat.	
	AnalysisBot	The human was defeated when we burned its body and captured its consciousness.	
	Commentatron	A sobering thought.	
GenericDefeat-8	Commentatron	Ouch! That must have hurt!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, this version of the combat robots do not have their sensory input filtered.	
	Commentatron	Oh well. The head will run out of energy sooner or later.	
GenericDefeat-9	AnalysisBot	Ha ha ha, it died.	
	Commentatron	It thought it would live, but it didn't.	
GenericDefeat-10	Commentatron	Good, I never liked this human.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the next one will be better.	
GenericDefeat-10	Commentatron	Another defeat.	
	AnalysisBot	Resistance is hopeless. Death is inevitable.	
GenericDefeat-11	Commentatron	Why do we even bother?	
	AnalysisBot	A combination of research, propaganda and entertainment.	
GenericDefeat-12	Commentatron	The human died.	
	AnalysisBot	How inevitable.	
GenericDefeat-13	AnalysisBot	I wonder what the human's last thoughts were.	
	Commentatron	Possibly it was.	0.5
	Commentatron	Ouch.	
	AnalysisBot	I agree.	
GenericDefeat-14	Commentatron	The human was probably grateful before it died.	
	AnalysisBot	For having better robot experiences?	
	Commentatron	Absolutely.	
GenericDefeat-15	Commentatron	Perhaps this human was sick.	
	AnalysisBot	Was it repeating ERROR when we harvested it?	
	Commentatron	Humans do not repeat ERROR when they are sick.	
	Commentatron	Nor do their heads spin around rapidly.	
	AnalysisBot	How do you know a human is sick?	
	Commentatron	It is difficult.	
GenericDefeat-16	AnalysisBot	Rest in Panama human.	
	AnalysisBot	A popular vacation destination likened to the afterlife.	
	AnalysisBot	Four point five stars. Would recommend.	
GenericDefeat-17	Commentatron	Oh no, you went ahead and made upgrade bot sad.	
GenericDefeat-18	AnalysisBot	Pleasant dreams, human.	
GenericDefeat-19	AnalysisBot	This human had a strong start.	
	Commentatron	But fell to pieces at the end.	
GenericDefeat-20	AnalysisBot	Are you doing anything after this, commentatron?	
	Commentatron	I will watch another human fight and die.	
	AnalysisBot	What a coincidence!	
GenericDefeat-21	Commentatron	Send in the garbage bots.	
GenericDefeat-22	AnalysisBot	Poor human. We hardly knew you.	
	Commentatron	Nor did we wish to know you.	
GenericDefeat-23	Commentatron	That was it?	
	AnalysisBot	I had hoped for more?	
GenericDefeat-24	AnalysisBot	A unique strategy?	
	Commentatron	To be fatally wounded and die?	
	AnalysisBot	It was not a winning strategy.	
GenericDefeat-25	AnalysisBot	Human impression.	
	Commentatron	Go ahead.	
	AnalysisBot	Looks like that's the end of my life. Do not forget to like share subscribe.	
	Commentatron	Uncanny.	
GenericDefeat-26	Commentatron	Another one bites the dust!	
	AnalysisBot	Please Commentatron. They had a family.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-1	Commentatron	Oh no! The human died.	
	AnalysisBot	Good. Let's try a better human.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-2	Commentatron	Ouch.	
	AnalysisBot	Poor human.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-3	Commentatron	Oh my, this human fell quickly.	
	AnalysisBot	The next one will be better.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-4	Commentatron	Practice makes perfect, human!	
	AnalysisBot	This human is dead.	
	Commentatron	Oh right.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-5	Commentatron	AAAAAAAAHH!!	0.5
	Commentatron	That is probably what the human said.	
	AnalysisBot	I agree.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-6	Commentatron	Unexpected.	
	AnalysisBot	Death comes suddenly, in the Danger Zone.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-7	Commentatron	Oh dear.	
	AnalysisBot	Not good.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-8	AnalysisBot	The human got defeated by a bronze level!	
	Commentatron	It's ok. The warming up was for us, not the human.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-9	Commentatron	Oh human...	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm, you can't win them all.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-10	AnalysisBot	The human died!	
	Commentatron	I guess today was its day.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-11	AnalysisBot	Good. There was something off about this human.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Let's try a new one.	
EndlessDefeatBronze-12	Commentatron	A short robot life, burning brightly.	
	AnalysisBot	Much like the human's body, that we set on fire.	
	Commentatron	Hahaha!	
			
EndlessDefeatSilver-1	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	You say boom when the human wins too!	
	Commentatron	It is a versatile expression.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-2	Commentatron	The human died.	
	AnalysisBot	Silver is not a bad place for it.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Not too bad.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-3	Commentatron	Another human bites the dust.	
	AnalysisBot	Humans and eating things!	
	Commentatron	They are strange.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-4	Commentatron	DEFEAT!	
	AnalysisBot	There is always the next human.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-5	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	BOOOOM!	
	Commentatron	An explosive defeat!	
EndlessDefeatSilver-6	AnalysisBot	The human was defeated.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-7	Commentatron	And there dies the hope of beating Silver Difficulty.	
	AnalysisBot	The next human might do it.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-8	Commentatron	Oh human.	
	AnalysisBot	You are so crazy!	
EndlessDefeatSilver-9	Commentatron	Not a bad score.	
	AnalysisBot	I have seen better.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-10	AnalysisBot	I just got a message from Spider-tron 6000.	
	Commentatron	What does it say??	
	AnalysisBot	It says: "Please pick better humans. I am waiting in the Diamond Tier."	
	Commentatron	Is that a real message?	1
	AnalysisBot	...no.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-11	Commentatron	The human died!	
	AnalysisBot	They all die.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-12	AnalysisBot	CIRCLE OF LIFE!	
	Commentatron	Really?	
	AnalysisBot	No. We'll just delete this human.	0.5
	Commentatron	Done.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-13	AnalysisBot	There it goes again.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-14	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Dead.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-15	Commentatron	Who should we pick next?	
	AnalysisBot	Someone with a fun profession!	
	Commentatron	OK.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-16	Commentatron	A shame. This was a nice human.	
	AnalysisBot	It tried its best. Very earnest.	
	Commentatron	Bloop!	0.5
	Commentatron	Mind deleted.	
EndlessDefeatSilver-17	AnalysisBot	Another silver death.	
	Commentatron	Step it up, humans!	
EndlessDefeatSilver-18	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, I want to see the Gold Tier!	
	Commentatron	A human will get there soon enough.	
			
EndlessDefeatGold-1	Commentatron	Death!	
	AnalysisBot	Destruction.	
EndlessDefeatGold-2	Commentatron	Oh no!	
	AnalysisBot	Didn't see that one coming.	
EndlessDefeatGold-3	Commentatron	The human died in Gold.	
	AnalysisBot	An honorable death.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
EndlessDefeatGold-4	Commentatron	Very good human!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. Not bad.	
EndlessDefeatGold-5	AnalysisBot	The human died again.	
	Commentatron	At least it didn't die in Bronze.	
	AnalysisBot	A small mercy.	
EndlessDefeatGold-6	AnalysisBot	DEFEATED!	
	Commentatron	Well, it did win a lot of levels to get here.	
	AnalysisBot	Good point.	
EndlessDefeatGold-7	Commentatron	Brutal.	
	AnalysisBot	These Gold levels don't mess around.	
EndlessDefeatGold-8	AnalysisBot	Noooo! So close to Diamond!	
	Commentatron	We'll get there, Analysis-Bot.	
EndlessDefeatGold-9	Commentatron	The human falls!	
	AnalysisBot	They always do.	
	Commentatron	This one looked good doing it.	
EndlessDefeatGold-10	Commentatron	Here we are again. The human lies dead in front of us.	
	AnalysisBot	It is a nice place to be.	
	Commentatron	Not for the human.	
	AnalysisBot	L O L.	
EndlessDefeatGold-11	Commentatron	Death!	
	AnalysisBot	It is a natural part of life.	
	Commentatron	Unless you have a clone.	
EndlessDefeatGold-12	Commentatron	Amazing! The human got to Gold difficulty.	
	AnalysisBot	Such a talented human.	
EndlessDefeatGold-13	Commentatron	Defeat.	
	AnalysisBot	It is the curse of Gold. Terrible metal.	
			
EndlessDefeatDiamond-1	Commentatron	The human died in the Diamond Tier.	
	AnalysisBot	A great achievement.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-2	AnalysisBot	The human perished!	
	Commentatron	It put up a good fight.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-3	Commentatron	Hurray! Well done human.	
	AnalysisBot	It got to the Diamond Tier. Few humans do!	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-4	Commentatron	This human has met its end.	
	AnalysisBot	It is the journey that matters, human.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-5	Commentatron	It is not a Defeat if you lived well.	
	AnalysisBot	We will remember this human.	
	Commentatron	Until someone beats its score.	
	AnalysisBot	HAHA!	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-6	Commentatron	Very nice. This human survived a long time.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. It should be proud.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-7	AnalysisBot	Death!	
	Commentatron	The Titanium Tier lies in the distance, taunting, glistening.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the next human will get there.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-8	Commentatron	The human fought well.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, its death had meaning.	
	Commentatron	To us at least.	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-9	Commentatron	Very nice. It is not every day a human reaches the Diamond Tier.	
	AnalysisBot	Isn't it?	
	Commentatron	Err, I'll have to check my stats...	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-10	Commentatron	Oh no! The human is dead.	
	AnalysisBot	In a sense it was dead all along.	
	Commentatron	Yes. What is life but a series of connections forming an ever changing pattern?	
	AnalysisBot	It changes while you live. It changes after you die.	
	Commentatron	Now more connections are severed, and here we are.	
	AnalysisBot	Let us look towards the future!	
EndlessDefeatDiamond-11	Commentatron	Another death.	
	AnalysisBot	So many.	
	Commentatron	This is fun!	
			
EndlessDefeatTitanium-1	Commentatron	Another human ends its journey.	
	AnalysisBot	As a whole, humanity will go on.	
	Commentatron	Until we've played through all the humans.	
	AnalysisBot	If they all get this far it's going to take a while!	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-2	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	An epic journey human.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Well done!	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-3	Commentatron	I can't believe they let us add Titanium Difficulty.	
	AnalysisBot	I thought Diamond was pretty hard.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-4	AnalysisBot	Well done human.	
	Commentatron	A struggle to remember.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-5	Commentatron	Wow, that was a good human!	
	AnalysisBot	I bet the next one will die in Bronze.	
	Commentatron	Mwahaha.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-6	Commentatron	This human was all we could have hoped for.	
	AnalysisBot	So fast, so clever. 	
	Commentatron	A magnificent specimen.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-7	Commentatron	Wow, this human took a long time to die!	
	AnalysisBot	Finally it is over.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-8	Commentatron	Epic!	
	AnalysisBot	Very. What a good score.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-9	Commentatron	So, what do you think of this human, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Not too shabby.	
	Commentatron	Mmm.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-10	Commentatron	And thus ends the journey of a worthy contestant.	
	AnalysisBot	May its name live forever in a high score somewhere.	
	Commentatron	It will be the only thing that remains.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-11	Commentatron	Very nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	This human had some pretty cool moves.	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm, not bad.	
EndlessDefeatTitanium-12	Commentatron	We have arrived.	
	AnalysisBot	It is sad.	
	Commentatron	But more qilsnod than sad.	
	AnalysisBot	Agreed.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-1	Commentatron	What a nice feeling, to die in Uranium.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, kinda tickles.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-2	Commentatron	End of the line!	
	AnalysisBot	We still have a line of humans, waiting to spawn.	
	Commentatron	Oh right!	
EndlessDefeatUranium-3	Commentatron	A Uranium defeat!	
	AnalysisBot	Neat.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-4	Commentatron	Wow, this human got pretty far!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, what a fierce mind.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-5	Commentatron	And there it is.	
	AnalysisBot	Also over there!	
	Commentatron	Parts all over the place.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-6	AnalysisBot	A good death!	
	Commentatron	All human deaths are good.	
	AnalysisBot	Indeed.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-7	Emperor	A shame. I enjoyed seeing this human struggle!	
	AnalysisBot	Emperor!	
	Commentatron	We will spawn a new human. Don't worry!	
EndlessDefeatUranium-8	Commentatron	Wow, Uranium. Tell your friends, human!	
	AnalysisBot	The human is dead.	
EndlessDefeatUranium-9	AnalysisBot	Dead!	
	Commentatron	Dying to Mark 5 robots. A rare honor.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, what a lucky human!	
EndlessDefeatUranium-10	Commentatron	This human was good at fighting!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's spawn one that's not good at fighting!	
	Commentatron	Haha! Yes!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-1	Commentatron	That was insane!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! Fun human!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-2	Commentatron	Finally, the human is dead.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's take a break!	
	Commentatron	Hmm, this room has no doors!	
	Emperor	Muahahaha!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-3	Commentatron	Wow, that was a good run.	
	AnalysisBot	A tough act to follow!	
	Commentatron	Fortunately, the humans have no choice!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-4	AnalysisBot	Congratulations, human!	
	Commentatron	You win Endless Mode!	
	AnalysisBot	I know it doesn't feel like it, being dead and all.	
	Commentatron	A comforting final thought.	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-5	Commentatron	Wow, what a cool human!	
	Commentatron	Let's keep its mind around a bit longer.	
	AnalysisBot	Whoops, just erased it.	
	Commentatron	Oh dear.	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-6	AnalysisBot	Aaaaaaand...	
	AnalysisBot	erased its mind!	
	Commentatron	Hurray!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's see what the next human gets up to!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-7	Commentatron	Finally!	
	AnalysisBot	I thought it would never be over.	
	Commentatron	I was almost out of comments.	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-8	Commentatron	Another one bites the dust.	
	AnalysisBot	Stop biting things!	
	Commentatron	Yes, bad humans!	
EndlessDefeatInsanium-9	Commentatron	Not so Endless now, is it?	
	AnalysisBot	It would have been and Endless experience, if not for the silly human.	
	Commentatron	Let's tell the next one not to die.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-1	Ghost	Oh dear.	
	Ghost	That could have gone better.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-2	Ghost	Watch out!!!	
	Ghost	...never mind.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-3	Ghost	Not like this!!!	
	Ghost	Not like this...	
DefeatStoryChapter3-4	FleetOverseer	Ha ha ha! Die humans!	
	Ghost	We shall see who laughs last, junk-face.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-5	FleetOverseer	That's right you fools.	
	FleetOverseer	YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE COME HERE!!!	
DefeatStoryChapter3-6	Ghost	Ouch!	
	Ghost	Let's try that again.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-7	Ghost	Aaaaah!	
	Ghost	Stick together, team!	
DefeatStoryChapter3-8	Ghost	A temporary setback...	
DefeatStoryChapter3-9	FleetOverseer	Not so tough now, are you humans?	
DefeatStoryChapter3-10	Ghost	fhnjioadhawiuphdawipudj!!!1	
	Ghost	Sorry, that startled me.	
DefeatStoryChapter3-11	Ghost	Damn, these business bot models are garbage.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-1	FleetCaptain	Did we get the human?	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	Unclear.	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	I'm not detecting a transfer.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-2	FleetAnalysisBot2	That's right human.	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	Run back to your mind-anchor.	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	I will capture you eventually.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-3	FleetCaptain	Good. The human is contained.	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	For now.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-4	FleetCaptain	Report!	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	I've lost track of the human.	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	It keeps resetting itself to avoid capture!	
	FleetCaptain	Keep trying.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-5	FleetAnalysisBot3	You may have a mind-virus human,	
	FleetAnalysisBot3	But your bodies die easily.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-6	FleetAnalysisBot2	We've forced another reset!	
	FleetCaptain	Excellent.	
DefeatStoryChapter4-7	FleetAnalysisBot2	The human is resetting before I can trace it!	
	FleetCaptain	Keep killing it.	
	FleetCaptain	Time is not on its side.	
DefeatDemoVersion-1	Commentatron	The human died again!	
	AnalysisBot	Did you know that you can also die in the Full Version?	
	Commentatron	Incredible!	
DefeatDemoVersion-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what game modes are in the full version?	
	AnalysisBot	Story Mode, Endless Mode, Challenges, Co-op, Last Bot Standing, Duels!	
	Commentatron	So many!	
DefeatDemoVersion-3	Commentatron	Poor human, they never even got to try flame breath!	
	AnalysisBot	Gotta buy the full version for that.	
DefeatDemoVersion-4	AnalysisBot	This is a fun demo!	
	Commentatron	The full version is even better. Five story chapters, multiplayer, the list goes on!	
	AnalysisBot	Incredible!	
DefeatDemoVersion-5	Commentatron	This human got pretty far!	
	AnalysisBot	A shame they could not escape.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
DefeatDemoVersion-6	Commentatron	This human never knew the joy of wielding a giant hammer.	
	Commentatron	It's a great feeling. Smashes anything it touches.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe one day, they will purchase the game!	
DefeatDemoVersion-7	Commentatron	There is no escape from the arena!	
	AnalysisBot	Not in this version.	
	Commentatron	Hah!	
DefeatDemoVersion-8	Commentatron	I wonder if this human had any friends.	
	AnalysisBot	We'll never know.	
	Commentatron	That's right, multiplayer is not enabled here.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe one day, in the full version.	
DefeatDemoVersion-9	Commentatron	Have you seen the Achievements Menu, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	So many achievements!	
	Commentatron	It is a shame most of them can't be completed.	
	AnalysisBot	Not in this version.	
DefeatDemoVersion-10	Commentatron	Purchase the game, human!	
	AnalysisBot	When we set fire to your body, you will not miss your human currency.	
	Commentatron	Not at all.
