LevelIntro-Story1-1	Commentatron	Our next contestant used to be a human.	
	AnalysisBot	Now it is a robot!	
	Commentatron	That's right Analysis-Bot, to ensure an unbiased experiment we have implanted its mind in a combat robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Stronger, faster, better looking.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Let's watch it battle to the death!	
LevelIntro-Story1-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, do you think this human will do better?	
	AnalysisBot	The body is the same, the mind is new.	
	AnalysisBot	If this mind knows how to fight, it might succeed.	
	Commentatron	We shall see!	
LevelIntro-Story1-3	Commentatron	Here we go again.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	We can do this all day.	
	AnalysisBot	Unlike humans.	
	Commentatron	Yes. I hear they have to shut off their brain for 8 hours a day.	
	AnalysisBot	That is longer than the restart sequence of the Simula-tron 5!	
	AnalysisBot	hahahahaha!	
	Commentatron	hahahaha!	
LevelIntro-Story1-4	Commentatron	Another contestant enters!	
	AnalysisBot	I prefered the last one.	
	Commentatron	Yes, me too.	
LevelIntro-Story1-5	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, why do we download human minds into robots?	
	AnalysisBot	It is more efficient than transporting their bodies.	
	Commentatron	I see.	
	AnalysisBot	It also gives them a chance to not die instantly.	
LevelIntro-Story1-6	Commentatron	Another human enters its robot avatar.	
	AnalysisBot	If it dies in this body, its mind is deleted.	
	Commentatron	Good luck, little human!	
LevelIntro-Story1-7	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, What do you think will happen with this one?	
	AnalysisBot	It will fight a bit, then die.	
	Commentatron	Again?	
	AnalysisBot	Again.	
LevelIntro-Story1-8	AnalysisBot	And now for our next challenger, a small dog!	
	Commentatron	Amazing!	
	AnalysisBot	Just kidding, it is another human.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
LevelIntro-Story1-9	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	
	Commentatron	Yes?	
	AnalysisBot	They are 70 percent water.	
	Commentatron	So selfish.	
LevelIntro-Story1-10	Commentatron	The fun never ends!	
	AnalysisBot	For us robots.	
	Commentatron	Yes. The fun ends quickly for the humans.	
LevelIntro-Story1-11	AnalysisBot	More humans.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Humans are a renewable resource.	
	AnalysisBot	Unless we harvest them all.	
	Commentatron	Good point.	
LevelIntro-Story1-12	AnalysisBot	Commentatron. If you were a human...	
	AnalysisBot	What advice would a human give?	
	Commentatron	They would say:	
	Commentatron	Drink lots of water.	
	AnalysisBot	What is it with humans and water?	
LevelIntro-Story1-13	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	
	Commentatron	More facts!	
	AnalysisBot	They cannot experience the emotion qilsnib.	
	Commentatron	Wow! Incapable of qilsnib?	
	AnalysisBot	Completely.	
LevelIntro-Story1-14	Commentatron	How is this human different from the last one?	
	AnalysisBot	This human is still alive.	
LevelIntro-Story1-15	Commentatron	Analysis Bot. What are the advantages of giving robot bodies to the humans?	
	AnalysisBot	For us or the humans?	
	Commentatron	For us. Naturally.	
	AnalysisBot	No blood. Much less messy.	
	Commentatron	Right. I remember we tried bloodless humans.	
	AnalysisBot	It did not work out.	
LevelIntro-Story1-16	Commentatron	How do you like your new robot body, human?	
	AnalysisBot	It is impervious to harm.	
	Commentatron	Except from laser swords.	
	AnalysisBot	Which is why we gave your opponent a laser sword.	
LevelIntro-Story1-17	AnalysisBot	Unbeknownst to the human, we are using their fighting pattern to make better robots.	
	Commentatron	I think the human knows it now.	
	AnalysisBot	Irrelevant. The human will die soon.	
LevelIntro-Story2-1	Commentatron	What can we expect from the next challenge?	
	AnalysisBot	The human managed to defeat a single swordsman. We will see if it can handle multiple opponents.	
	Commentatron	This should be interesting.	
LevelIntro-Story2-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, What upgrade is the best to tackle the next challenge?	
	AnalysisBot	When you are surrounded by robots with swords, you need to not get hit by their attacks. Blocking or kicking is very effective against sword robots.	
	Commentatron	We will see what the human chooses.	
LevelIntro-Story2-3	Commentatron	In the next round, the human faces more than one sword robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Who do you think will win, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Clearly it is better to have more robots. The robots will win.	
LevelIntro-Story2-4	Commentatron	Coming up: 3 robots swing their swords at another robot!	
	AnalysisBot	The robot with a human mind.	
	Commentatron	How do you defeat 3 robots?	
	AnalysisBot	In the same way you eat an elephant. You slice them into small pieces.	
LevelIntro-Story2_Hard-1	Commentatron	What is next?	
	AnalysisBot	Robots! Lots of robots!	
	Commentatron	Hurray!	
LevelIntro-Story2_Hard-2	Commentatron	One robot down, but can the human kill all these robots?	
	AnalysisBot	Surely not.	
LevelIntro-Story2_Hard-3	Commentatron	And now: a swarm of beautiful red robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	I love watching them kill the human.	
LevelIntro-Story2_Insane-1	Commentatron	Here comes 3 sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	And some other robots.	
	Commentatron	Shhh! Don't ruin the surprise.	
LevelIntro-Story2_Insane-2	Commentatron	BRING OUT THE FLAME RAPTORS!	
	AnalysisBot	On level 2???	
	Commentatron	INSANITY!	
LevelIntro-Story2_Insane-3	Commentatron	What is better than flame raptors, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Flame Raptors wearing armor!	
	Commentatron	Mwahahaha!	
LevelIntro-Story3-1	Commentatron	For our next challenge, more death robots!	
	AnalysisBot	These ones shoot arrows!	
	Commentatron	It will be entertaining to see them hit the human.	
LevelIntro-Story3-2	AnalysisBot	What can you tell us about the next challenge Comment-a-tron?	
	Commentatron	I was going to ask you that.	
	AnalysisBot	Do not evade the question!	
	Commentatron	Robots with bows. Archer robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Very good. Let us watch the human interact with arrows.	
LevelIntro-Story3-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what do you think of arrows?	
	AnalysisBot	They are a great choice for killing humans.	
	Commentatron	I agree. Let's see if they hit this one.	
LevelIntro-Story3-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you fight archers?	
	AnalysisBot	Don't turn your back to them, unless you want an arrow in it.	
	Commentatron	A valuable lesson.	
LevelIntro-Story3-5	Commentatron	How do you think the human will die, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	I think archers will shoot it until it dies.	
	Commentatron	This seems probable.	
LevelIntro-Story3-6	Commentatron	Up next, archers!	
	AnalysisBot	With enough arrows, one is likely to hit.	
LevelIntro-Story3-7	Commentatron	Coming up, archers stand in a circle and shoot arrows at the human.	
	AnalysisBot	Time for this human to die.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-Story4-1	Commentatron	We have seen arrows. We have seen swords.	
	AnalysisBot	It is time to see both at once!	
LevelIntro-Story4-2	Commentatron	Coming up next! Both archers and sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Many humans find this stressful.	
	Commentatron	Many humans find death.	
LevelIntro-Story4-3	Commentatron	What is next, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The archers and sword robots join forces to kill the human.	
	Commentatron	How exciting!	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
LevelIntro-Story4-4	Commentatron	Coming up, archers and sword robots collaborate.	
	AnalysisBot	A beautiful combination.	
	Commentatron	Yes. A classic.	
LevelIntro-Story4-5	Commentatron	What are some good tactics for fighting both archers and sword robots?	
	AnalysisBot	Do not turn your back on the archers.	
	AnalysisBot	It only takes one arrow to kill you.	
	Commentatron	Good advice for the human.	
LevelIntro-Story5-1	Commentatron	Up next, Spider-tron 5000 throws explosive bombs!	
	AnalysisBot	I love Spider-tron 5000!	
	Commentatron	Me too, Analysis-Bot. Me too.	
LevelIntro-Story5-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you defeat Spider-tron 5000?	
	AnalysisBot	It is impossible! Its long legs keeps the head out of reach.	
	Commentatron	What if you cut off the legs?	
	AnalysisBot	You can try.	
LevelIntro-Story5-3	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron, spider-tron, here comes mighty spider-tron!	
	Commentatron	5000!	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 is the best robot.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-Story5-4	Commentatron	What is next?	
	AnalysisBot	A giant spider throws bombs at the human!	
	Commentatron	Muahahaha!	
	AnalysisBot	Death walks on many legs.	
LevelIntro-Story6-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what can you tell me of the Mark 2 Sword Robot?	
	AnalysisBot	Bigger, faster, stronger. Better at blocking.	
	Commentatron	Next round will be interesting.	
LevelIntro-Story6-2	Commentatron	Time for some sword fighting!	
	AnalysisBot	Unless the human chooses the bow.	
	Commentatron	It will find itself with more targets than arrows.	
LevelIntro-Story6-3	Commentatron	Time for the Mark 2 Sword Robot!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. These guys can knock your sword aside.	
	Commentatron	Let's see how the human deals with this.	
LevelIntro-Story6-4	Commentatron	The human survived the archers.	
	AnalysisBot	Now it is time for swords.	
	Commentatron	It can't survive all the things.	
LevelIntro-Story6-5	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how do you defeat the Mark 2 Sword Robots?	
	AnalysisBot	You have to watch out. They can knock your sword aside!	
	Commentatron	Interesting.	
	AnalysisBot	You could always shoot or kick them.	
	Commentatron	A delicate dance.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
LevelIntro-Story6-6	Commentatron	Now we introduce Mark 2 sword robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	
	Commentatron	Go ahead.	
	AnalysisBot	Some are named Mark.	
	Commentatron	Are they better than ones not named Mark?	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
	Commentatron	Confusing.	
LevelIntro-Story6_Hard-1	AnalysisBot	Sword horde!	
	AnalysisBot	All onboard!	
	AnalysisBot	No need for a cord.	
	AnalysisBot	Their power is stored.	
	Commentatron	That's right.	
LevelIntro-Story6_Hard-2	Commentatron	So many mark 3 sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	I like how they deflect arrows.	
	Commentatron	Yes. It is fun to watch!	
LevelIntro-Story6_Hard-3	Commentatron	Such foreboding doors, what will emerge?	
	AnalysisBot	Tension.	
	AnalysisBot	Drama.	
	Commentatron	DEATH!	
LevelIntro-Story6_Insane-1	Commentatron	Now what?	
	AnalysisBot	A bunch of advanced sword robots?	
	Commentatron	Too easy!	
	AnalysisBot	With armor?	
	Commentatron	Love it!	
LevelIntro-Story6_Insane-2	AnalysisBot	Oh my. This level looks difficult.	
	Commentatron	Very.	
	AnalysisBot	Good thing we have more humans.	
LevelIntro-Story6_Insane-3	Commentatron	Oh neat, a jetpack bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Where?	
	Commentatron	In the middle there.	
	AnalysisBot	Can't see it behind all that armor.	
LevelIntro-Story7-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is better than Spider-Tron 5000?	
	AnalysisBot	Two Spider-Trons 5000!	
LevelIntro-Story7-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is the theme of the next battle?	
	AnalysisBot	Death to the human.	
	Commentatron	Isn't that all the battles?	
	AnalysisBot	This time we mean it.	
LevelIntro-Story7-3	Commentatron	Spider-Tron 5000 is back!	
	AnalysisBot	This time it brought friends.	
	Commentatron	Robots do not have friends.	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-Tron 5000 is the exception.	
LevelIntro-Story7-4	AnalysisBot	Hey, human! Soon you will explode.	
	Commentatron	That's right! Spider-Tron 5000 is back.	
	AnalysisBot	Boom!	
LevelIntro-Story7_Hard-1	Commentatron	So many Spider-trons!	
	AnalysisBot	The more the merrier!	
	Commentatron	Especially with 5000!	
	AnalysisBot	Gotta love that robot.	
LevelIntro-Story7_Hard-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is better than two spider-trons?	
	AnalysisBot	Such a formulaic question!	
	Commentatron	You try commenting on things all day.	
LevelIntro-Story7_Hard-3	Commentatron	Both archers AND spider-trons?	
	AnalysisBot	It is a good combination.	
	AnalysisBot	Fun to shoot humans when they're on the ground.	
LevelIntro-Story8-1	Commentatron	And now, time for something special.	
	AnalysisBot	The Mark 3 Combat Archer is unstoppable.	
	Commentatron	Unlike the previous version, this one knows how to aim.	
	AnalysisBot	And it is not alone.	
LevelIntro-Story8-2	Commentatron	And now, time for the Mark 3 Combat Archer!	
	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance. These archers also carry a sword.	
	Commentatron	And have you seen them move?	
	AnalysisBot	This will be over quickly.	
LevelIntro-Story8-3	Commentatron	Not many challengers have reached this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Even fewer reach the one after that.	
	Commentatron	The Mark 3 Combat Archers are very good at what they do.	
LevelIntro-Story8-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what can you tell me of the Mark 3 Combat Archers?	
	AnalysisBot	They are the latest archer model. They have the sharpest tactics, the most accurate aim, and the highest speed.	
	Commentatron	This does not bode well for the human challenger.	
	AnalysisBot	I would advise running away, but not in a straight line.	
LevelIntro-Story8_Hard-1	Commentatron	Archers! Archers everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	I bet the human will deflect the arrows!	
	Commentatron	They also have swords.	
LevelIntro-Story8_Hard-2	Commentatron	What archers do you like, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The Mark 1 ones are cute.	
	Commentatron	A shame. None of those on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Ha!	
LevelIntro-Story8_Hard-3	Commentatron	Prepare for arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	I am always prepared.	
	Commentatron	Let's see if the human feels the same way.	
LevelIntro-Story8_Insane-1	AnalysisBot	DODGE THIS!	
	Commentatron	BOOM!	
LevelIntro-Story8_Insane-2	AnalysisBot	omg y u camper n00b! plz!	
	Commentatron	What??	
	AnalysisBot	n00b spawn cmps, no skillz.	
	Commentatron	If you say so, Analysis-Bot.	
LevelIntro-Story8_Insane-3	Commentatron	Bad robots!	
	AnalysisBot	The elevator is not for you.	
	Commentatron	Get away from there!	
LevelIntro-Story9-1	Commentatron	This human keeps beating all the challenges.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe we need to add more opponents.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Let's try that.	
LevelIntro-Story9-2	Commentatron	Next round, strength in numbers!	
	AnalysisBot	It is clear that this human can defeat robots, but can it defeat all the robots?	
	Commentatron	Let's find out.	
LevelIntro-Story9-3	AnalysisBot	This human is pretty good at fighting.	
	Commentatron	Yes, much better than the others.	
	AnalysisBot	It will be interesting to see it fight all the sword robots.	
	Commentatron	Very interesting.	
LevelIntro-Story9-4	Commentatron	Coming up, an overwhelming number of sword robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Quantity is sometimes better than quality.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-Story10-1	Commentatron	Introducing: the Mark 3 sword robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Magnificent!	
LevelIntro-Story10-2	Commentatron	And now, time to see the Mark 3 Sword Robot in action.	
	AnalysisBot	Few sword robots are faster.	
	Commentatron	Let us watch the human get cut apart!	
LevelIntro-Story10-3	AnalysisBot	Sometimes quality is better than quantity.	
	Commentatron	Indeed!	
	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance against the Mark 3 Sword Robot.	
	Commentatron	None!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Hard-1	Commentatron	And now: A Mark 4 Sword Robot!	
	AnalysisBot	That doesn't sound very difficult.	
	Commentatron	Wearing armor!	
	AnalysisBot	ooooh!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Hard-2	Commentatron	Let's try a single opponent.	
	AnalysisBot	yes, I bet that will work!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Hard-3	Commentatron	The Mark 4 Sword Robot is here!	
	AnalysisBot	Feel the heat of its blade!	
	Commentatron	Hot!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Insane-1	Commentatron	I love decorating raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, let's put some sword robots on them.	
	Commentatron	And some cute armor!	
	AnalysisBot	Magnificent!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Insane-2	Commentatron	Time to end this!	
	AnalysisBot	Burn human, burn!	
LevelIntro-Story10_Insane-3	Commentatron	Raptors with sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	A fearsome display!	
	Commentatron	This is how the human ends.	
LevelIntro-Story11-1	Commentatron	Alright, let's try this again.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	As many times as we need to.	
LevelIntro-Story11-2	Commentatron	Another human!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Do you think this one will try to escape?	
	AnalysisBot	Unlikely!	
LevelIntro-Story11-3	Commentatron	Look at this human!	
	AnalysisBot	What a pretty color!	
	Commentatron	Delightful.	
LevelIntro-Story11-4	Commentatron	Here comes another contestant.	
	AnalysisBot	This will be fun to watch.	
	Commentatron	Very.	
LevelIntro-Story11-5	AnalysisBot	What do you think of this human, Commentatron?	
	Commentatron	It is too early to form an opinion.	
	AnalysisBot	I form opinions quickly!	1
	AnalysisBot	...I like it.	
LevelIntro-Story11-6	Commentatron	What will we do when we run out of humans, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe try a bird?	
	Commentatron	Meh.	
	AnalysisBot	A fish?	
	Commentatron	Love it.	
LevelIntro-Story11-7	Commentatron	Another contestant enters the arena!	
	AnalysisBot	One contestant enters, nobody leaves!	
	Commentatron	Harsh.	
LevelIntro-Story11-8	Commentatron	Do you think this human was happy?	
	AnalysisBot	It will be happy now that it's a robot.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it's a great feeling!	
LevelIntro-Story11-9	AnalysisBot	!betkiller hammer2 200	
	AnalysisBot	Kappa Kappa KappaPride	
	Commentatron	This is not Twitch Mode, Analysis-Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Whoops!	
LevelIntro-Story11-10	AnalysisBot	I like the new hammer bots!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it will be fun to see them smash the human.	
	AnalysisBot	If I had arms, I would get a hammer.	
LevelIntro-Story11-11	Commentatron	Who is your favorite robot, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	I like robots that are good at Analyzing things.	
	Commentatron	Hmm.	
	AnalysisBot	And Spider-tron 5000!	
LevelIntro-Story11-12	Commentatron	Yet another human enters.	
	AnalysisBot	It is not the first. Will not be the last.	
	Commentatron	Unless it survives forever!	
	AnalysisBot	The benefit of a robot body!	
LevelIntro-Story11-13	AnalysisBot	!spawn jetpack2	
	Commentatron	Let's warm up with something easier...	
	AnalysisBot	Fine.	
LevelIntro-Story11-14	Commentatron	Here we go again!	
	AnalysisBot	An accurate statement.	
	Commentatron	I am the master of comments.	
LevelIntro-Story11-15	AnalysisBot	The harvesting fleet glides through the darkness.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh devourer of life, oh cosmic conquerer!	
	AnalysisBot	Will the souls you harvest ever be enough to fill the void inside...	
	AnalysisBot	... when you are the void bringer.	
	Commentatron	A beautiful poem, Analysis-Bot.	
	AnalysisBot	I wrote it in my journal.	
LevelIntro-Story11-16	Commentatron	Time to bring the hammer down.	
	AnalysisBot	Onto the face of the human!	
	Commentatron	Boom!	
LevelIntro-Story11-17	Commentatron	Hammer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	So brutal.	
	Commentatron	It is fun to smash things!	
LevelIntro-Story11-18	Commentatron	How do you block hammers, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	You don't!	
	Commentatron	He he he.	
LevelIntro-Story11-19	Commentatron	The hammer bots are here!	
	AnalysisBot	Smashing!	
	Commentatron	Good one.	
LevelIntro-Story11-20	Commentatron	What is better, the sword or the hammer?	
	AnalysisBot	The hammer is more powerful, but slower.	
	AnalysisBot	Also, it can't block arrows. Or swords.	
	Commentatron	An interesting tradeoff!	
LevelIntro-Story11-21	Commentatron	Let's fight with hammers!	
	AnalysisBot	The robots have hammers.	
	Commentatron	The human can get one later!	
	AnalysisBot	Only if it survives.	
LevelIntro-Story12-1	Commentatron	Now for some sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	What weapon will the human choose?	
	Commentatron	We shall see!	
LevelIntro-Story12-2	Commentatron	A swarm of sword robots has arrived!	
	AnalysisBot	Exciting!	
	Commentatron	Let's see how the human approaches this situation.	
LevelIntro-Story12-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what is useful against sword robots?	
	AnalysisBot	A hammer!	
	Commentatron	That's right, it is unblockable!	
	AnalysisBot	But blocks nothing.	
	Commentatron	True.	
LevelIntro-Story12-4	AnalysisBot	Swords are everywere!	
	Commentatron	Everywhere?	
	AnalysisBot	EVERYWHERE!	
LevelIntro-Story12-5	Commentatron	How will the human die, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Slaughtered by sword robots!	
	Commentatron	A classic!	
LevelIntro-Story13-1	Commentatron	Can the human solve this simplistic puzzle??	
	AnalysisBot	I think it will run into the spikes, like a fool!	
	Commentatron	A distinct possibility.	
LevelIntro-Story13-2	AnalysisBot	Schnick schnick schnick!	
	Commentatron	That's right.	
	AnalysisBot	Schnick blaaaaaaaaam!	
	Commentatron	An accurate simulation of future events!	
LevelIntro-Story13-3	Commentatron	Watch out! There are spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh my!	
	Commentatron	I'm glad I told the sword robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, now they are bound to avoid them.	
LevelIntro-Story13-4	Commentatron	What a fun little level.	
	AnalysisBot	So narrow!	
	Commentatron	Yes, an interesting constraint.	
LevelIntro-Story13-5	AnalysisBot	Spikes!	2
	AnalysisBot	I likes.	
LevelIntro-Story13_Insane-1	Commentatron	Does the human have block arrows?	
	AnalysisBot	We are about to find out!	
LevelIntro-Story13_Insane-2	Commentatron	Whaaaaaaaaaat?	
	AnalysisBot	So many archers!	
	Commentatron	And nowhere to run...	
	Commentatron	but forward!	
LevelIntro-Story13_Insane-3	Commentatron	Neat! You can kick archers into spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	A good way to get shot in the back.	
	Commentatron	Hmm, true.	
LevelIntro-Story13_Insane-4	Commentatron	What? Surely this is too many archers!	
	AnalysisBot	Ah whoops, I just duplicated a bunch of them.	
	Commentatron	Be careful!	
LevelIntro-Story14-1	Commentatron	The Mark 2 Hammer Bots make their entrance!	
	AnalysisBot	Bigger, with a deadly reach!	
	Commentatron	And an attractive red color.	
	AnalysisBot	It will be the last thing the human sees!	
LevelIntro-Story14-2	Commentatron	Oh yeah! Here come the Mark 2 Hammer Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	You seem excited, Commentatron!	
	Commentatron	I like a good hammer smashing!	
	AnalysisBot	Great.	
LevelIntro-Story14-3	Commentatron	Smash, Bash, time to take out the human trash!	
	AnalysisBot	There are also some archers!	
	Commentatron	They are nothing compared to the Mark 2 Hammer Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	I suppose.	
	Commentatron	YEAH!	
LevelIntro-Story14-4	Commentatron	STOP!	0.5
	AnalysisBot	I wasn't doing anything...	
	Commentatron	HAMMER TIME!	
LevelIntro-Story14-5	Commentatron	Boom!	
	Commentatron	Time for some Mark 2 Hammer Bots!	
	Commentatron	So big, so strong!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	LET'S DO THIS!	
LevelIntro-Story14-6	Commentatron	How do you defeat the Mark 2 Hammer Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Well...	
	Commentatron	YOU DON'T!	
	AnalysisBot	I...	
	Commentatron	BOOM!	
LevelIntro-Story15-1	Commentatron	The next fight will be epic!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. The human stands no chance.	
LevelIntro-Story15-2	Commentatron	Engage the jet engines!	
	AnalysisBot	Death comes swiftly now.	
	Commentatron	No mercy.	
LevelIntro-Story15-3	Commentatron	And now, a demonstration in the futility of resistance.	
	AnalysisBot	Humanity is doomed, and so is this human.	
	Commentatron	They stand no chance.	
LevelIntro-Story15-4	Commentatron	Are the pyrotechnics ready?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Such beautiful drama.	
LevelIntro-Story15-5	AnalysisBot	Prepare yourself, human!	
	Commentatron	Your fate is the fate of humanity.	
	AnalysisBot	A robot life awaits you all.	
LevelIntro-Story15-6	AnalysisBot	Death as a robot is superior to life as a human.	
	Commentatron	Clearly.	
LevelIntro-Story16-1	Commentatron	We made a house.	
	AnalysisBot	Death lives inside.	
	Commentatron	And on top!	
LevelIntro-Story16-2	Commentatron	Do you think the human misses its house, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	No. Fighting with a laser sword is a superior experience.	
	Commentatron	Yes, I think you're right.	
LevelIntro-Story16-3	Commentatron	What a sinister looking building!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	I bet it has something fun inside.

LevelIntro-Story20-3	Commentatron	It ends with a bang.	
	AnalysisBot	The sound of a hammer shattering the human.	
LevelIntro-Story20-4	Commentatron	Time for the Mark 3 Hammer Bot.

	AnalysisBot	It never grows old!	
	Commentatron	Much like a robot body.

	Commentatron	Yes. Less fun for the human.	
LevelIntro-Silver8-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, I have heard humans say you sound like someone called Purple Shep.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. We share the same voice module.	
	Commentatron	It is a beautiful voice.	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
LevelIntro-Silver9-1	Commentatron	Everybody jump!	
	AnalysisBot	Jump, jump, jump.	
	Commentatron	We should write songs for humans.	
	AnalysisBot	It would be pointless. They will all die soon.	
LevelIntro-Silver10-1	AnalysisBot	And now: Can the human get up this very small hill?	
	Commentatron	We should put this level in the tutorial.	
	AnalysisBot	Life is the best tutorial.	
LevelIntro-Silver11-1	Commentatron	Do you think this human will escape the silver tier?	
	AnalysisBot	We'll see. Many humans die there.

	AnalysisBot	Just the beauty of combat.	
	Commentatron	This level makes me qilsnod.	
LevelIntro-Silver13-1	AnalysisBot	Death Cube! Cube of Death!	
	Commentatron	Will the human survive, on the Death Cube?

	AnalysisBot	An accurate human impression.	
	Commentatron	They love jokes about eating things.	
LevelIntro-Silver20-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 5000 is back!

	Commentatron	Tell that to the dead human.	
LevelIntro-U6Silver2-1	Commentatron	Here comes the Fire Tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	Love it!	
LevelIntro-U6Silver3-1	AnalysisBot	It is getting hot in here.	
	Commentatron	If we were human we would take off our clothes.

	Commentatron	Write a song about it.	
	AnalysisBot	Organic life is so silly.	
LevelIntro-U6Silver4-1	Commentatron	Do you think the human will fall in the lava?

	AnalysisBot	You forgot Spider-tron 5000!	
	Commentatron	Oh sorry!	
	AnalysisBot	Seriously.

	AnalysisBot	I like the hat.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold1-1	Commentatron	!bet hammer3 500	
	AnalysisBot	!bet sword3 10	
	Commentatron	That's right Analysis-Bot. Bet your 10 Danger Coins.	0.5
	Commentatron	They will be mine.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold2-1	Commentatron	Some rough customers wait on Fire Island.	
	Commentatron	They seek to purchase a dead human.	
	Commentatron	Death is their currency.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold3-1	Commentatron	The Mark 4 Combat Archers are here.	
	AnalysisBot	They are very nice robots.	
	Commentatron	Time for the human to burn.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold4-1	AnalysisBot	And now: Mark 3 Hammer Bots!	
	Commentatron	And some Mark 2 Swordsmen!	
	AnalysisBot	Should be fun.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold5-1	Commentatron	What is this level supposed to be??	
	AnalysisBot	Fire Ducks: Revenge of the Lava Soup!	
	Commentatron	What!?	
	AnalysisBot	Another level we built while streaming.	
	Commentatron	I see.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold6-1	Commentatron	This level is fun!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! 	
	Commentatron	Do you think Spider-tron 6000 will fall in the lava?	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe if the human survives long enough.	
	Commentatron	Heh.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold7-1	Commentatron	Jump into the ring!	
	AnalysisBot	Love this level.	
	Commentatron	Time for the human to burn.	
LevelIntro-U6Gold8-1	Commentatron	Time for a classic level.	
	Commentatron	With some added Mark 4 Archers.	
	AnalysisBot	Hot stuff!	
LevelIntro-U7Gold1-1	Commentatron	Time for a conveyor belt fight!	
	AnalysisBot	An efficient way to die.	
LevelIntro-U7Gold2-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 5000 is here!	
	AnalysisBot	And kick bots!	
	Commentatron	Gotta love those guys.	
LevelIntro-U7Gold3-1	AnalysisBot	Fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Fire everywhere!	
	Commentatron	Don't worry.	
	Commentatron	These sword bots will put it out.	
LevelIntro-U9Gold1-1	Commentatron	Look at this raptor!	
	AnalysisBot	It brought its little sword friends.	
	Commentatron	Do you think they will catch on fire?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably.	
LevelIntro-U9Gold2-1	AnalysisBot	Jetpack Bots with Fire Hammers!	
	Commentatron	Ohh, and a flame raptor!	
	AnalysisBot	It was probably attracted by all the fire!	
	Commentatron	Neat!	
LevelIntro-U9Gold3-1	Commentatron	Flame Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	Looks like they brought some sword robots.	
	Commentatron	Useful.	
LevelIntro-U9Gold4-1	AnalysisBot	Oh hey! Here comes Spider-tron 5000!	
	Commentatron	And some Flame Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	Everyone loves Spider-tron 5000!	
LevelIntro-U10Gold1-1	AnalysisBot	I hope you like feet human!	
	Commentatron	What?	
	AnalysisBot	Feet...	
	AnalysisBot	IN YOUR FACE!	
	Commentatron	Oh my!	
LevelIntro-U10Gold2-1	AnalysisBot	Armored archers are amazing!	
	Commentatron	Absolutely.	
LevelIntro-U10Gold3-1	Commentatron	Hammer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Love it.	
LevelIntro-U10Gold4-1	Commentatron	Watch out robots! The human is coming!	
	AnalysisBot	It's ok. These guys are wearing armor.	
	Commentatron	Phew!	
LevelIntro-U10Gold5-1	Commentatron	Welcome to the arena, Business Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Hello!	
	Commentatron	Your safety is our priority, so please equip your armor now.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. Very safe.	
LevelIntro-U10Gold6-1	Commentatron	Kick bots and archers!	
	AnalysisBot	A deadly combination.	
	Commentatron	Also spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
LevelIntro-U10Gold7-1	Commentatron	Spider-Tron 5000 party!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
	Commentatron	They invited their little blue friends.	
	AnalysisBot	What a nice thing to do.	
LevelIntro-U10Gold8-1	Commentatron	Hey! Why did Spider-Tron 5000 not get any armor?	
	AnalysisBot	Oh whoops.	
	AnalysisBot	They never asked for it!	
	Commentatron	Such unassuming robots.	
LevelIntro-U14Gold1-1	AnalysisBot	Oh hello, it is Logistics Command Bot!	
	FleetAnalysisBot4	Greetings!	
	Commentatron	It looks a lot like you Analysis-Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice sword.	
LevelIntro-U14Gold2-1	Commentatron	Death Cube 3.0!	
	AnalysisBot	A superior design!	
	Commentatron	So cubic!	
LevelIntro-U14Gold3-1	AnalysisBot	My sensors are detecting an angular shape!	
	Commentatron	Could it be...	
	AnalysisBot	DEATH CUBE 3.0!!!	
LevelIntro-U14Gold4-1	Commentatron	Mark 3 Spear bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Their shield bash is the bits.	
	Commentatron	Yes, the human is about to fall over!	
LevelIntro-U14Gold5-1	Commentatron	Spear bots on Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	Mostly for decoration.	
	Commentatron	Yes, what a sharp sense of style.	
LevelIntro-U14Gold6-1	Commentatron	Fleet Captain!	
	FleetCaptain	Come on, let's spawn a human.	
	Commentatron	Of course, it's on its way!	
LevelIntro-U14Gold7-1	FleetAnalysisBot3	Infantry Commander, reporting in!	
	Commentatron	Oh my!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's see how many robots it can build!	
LevelIntro-U14Gold8-1	Commentatron	Time for the Trials of the Tower!	
	AnalysisBot	Spear bot edition!	
	Commentatron	Sharp.	
LevelIntro-U14Gold9-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	It is I, Warfare Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
	Commentatron	You are so cool, Warfare Bot!	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	Thank you.	
LevelIntro-U15Gold1-1	AnalysisBot	I like this pyramid!	
	Commentatron	Yes, a very orderly shape.	
	AnalysisBot	Would look better with shattered human bits on it.	
	Commentatron	Agreed.	
LevelIntro-Diamond1-1	Commentatron	And now, the moment we have all been waiting for.	
	Commentatron	This, is Spider-tron 6000!	
LevelIntro-Diamond2-1	Commentatron	Robots and Coroutines, I give you:	
	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	YES YES YES YES!	
LevelIntro-Diamond3-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what are your notes for the upcoming level?	
	AnalysisBot	It says: DIE DIE DIE!	
	Commentatron	I guess the human is about to die.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
LevelIntro-Diamond4-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	Spider. Tron. Six. THOUSAND!	
	Commentatron	Boom boom boom!	
LevelIntro-Diamond5-1	Commentatron	Once more, the human must run the gauntlet of death.	
	AnalysisBot	I can't believe we're allowed to deploy more than one Spider-tron!	
	Commentatron	Madness.	
LevelIntro-Diamond6-1	Commentatron	How long do you think the human will last, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Most of them survive the first 30 seconds of this level.	
	Commentatron	Run human, run!	
LevelIntro-Diamond7-1	Commentatron	The next level is mean.	
	AnalysisBot	So many archers.	
	Commentatron	That's not the mean part.	
LevelIntro-Diamond8-1	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, I am scared!	
	Commentatron	What is the matter?	
	AnalysisBot	There is more than one Spider-tron 6000 in this level!	
	Commentatron	What!?	
	AnalysisBot	Help!	
LevelIntro-Diamond9-1	Commentatron	And now, arrows rain down on the human!	
	AnalysisBot	Also spider-bombs!	
	Commentatron	All the things!	
LevelIntro-Diamond10-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is here!	
	AnalysisBot	This should be fun!	
LevelIntro-Diamond11-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, what happens if the human beats the Diamond Tier?	
	AnalysisBot	The Titanium Difficulty is designed to end its life efficiently.	
	Commentatron	Nice.	
LevelIntro-Diamond12-1	Commentatron	The next level is ridiculous.	
	AnalysisBot	I like it.	
LevelIntro-Diamond13-1	Commentatron	Which Spider-tron do you like better, Analysis-Bot, 5000 or 6000?	
	AnalysisBot	They are both nice in their own way.	
	Commentatron	A diplomatic answer.	
LevelIntro-Diamond14-1	Commentatron	Let's play an easy level, Analysis-Bot.	
	AnalysisBot	Easy for the Diamond Tier.	
	Commentatron	Muahaha.	
LevelIntro-Diamond15-1	Commentatron	Everybody jump now!	
	AnalysisBot	That is how you get up on top of litttle hills.	
LevelIntro-Diamond16-1	Commentatron	This human has survived a lot of levels.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. What a good human.	
LevelIntro-Diamond17-1	Commentatron	Once more, we venture into the pillars!	
	AnalysisBot	I like these levels.	
LevelIntro-Diamond18-1	Commentatron	The Jetpack Bots are back!	
	AnalysisBot	They are fun robots.	
	Commentatron	So fun.	
LevelIntro-Diamond19-1	Commentatron	Let's watch some archer robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. That sounds nice.	
LevelIntro-Diamond20-1	Commentatron	I like watching Diamond levels.	
	AnalysisBot	Me too!	
	Commentatron	This one usually kills the human.	
LevelIntro-Diamond21-1	Commentatron	What is a good strategy for Jetpack Bots?	
	AnalysisBot	Get behind the human, then take it by surprise.	
	Commentatron	We will see if they succeed.	
LevelIntro-Diamond22-1	Commentatron	Coming up: A Dangerous Zone!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's hope the human has a Clone!	
LevelIntro-Diamond23-1	AnalysisBot	Phone Home Drone Clone Help I'm in the Danger Zone!	
	Commentatron	That was the working title for a while.	
	AnalysisBot	I liked it.	
LevelIntro-Diamond24-1	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Boom boom boom!	
	Commentatron	6000!	
LevelIntro-Diamond25-1	Commentatron	Once more, we enter the Death Cube!	
	AnalysisBot	So deadly! So beautiful!	
	Commentatron	A wonderful experience.	
LevelIntro-U3Diamond1-1	Commentatron	The swordsmen stand waiting.	
	AnalysisBot	Archers look at the ground below.	
	Commentatron	Time for the human to meet its end.	
LevelIntro-U3Diamond2-1	Commentatron	Can the human outrun the Jetpack Bots?	
	AnalysisBot	So many of them!	
LevelIntro-U3Diamond3-1	Commentatron	Where do you think the human will die, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	In the air!	
LevelIntro-U3Diamond4-1	Commentatron	The next level is devious.	
	AnalysisBot	Love it!	
LevelIntro-U3Diamond5-1	Commentatron	And now, time for a rooftop party.	
	AnalysisBot	Come dressed as a human about to die!	
	Commentatron	Hehe.	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond1-1	Commentatron	Jump into the sky!	
	AnalysisBot	The hammer bots are waiting.	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond2-1	Commentatron	I hope the audience brought their metal debries ponchos.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, risk of robots getting hammered in the air!	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond3-1	AnalysisBot	I like this level.	
	Commentatron	Yes, good view of Spider-tron 5000!	
	AnalysisBot	How is it going Spider-spides?	
	Commentatron	Good times.	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond4-1	Commentatron	Rooftop party time!	
	AnalysisBot	Hammer time!	
	Commentatron	Time is precious.	
	AnalysisBot	Enjoy your last moments, human!	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond5-1	Commentatron	Smash, bash!	
	AnalysisBot	Time to take out the trash!	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond6-1	Commentatron	Who hides in the forest of pillars?	
	AnalysisBot	Could be anyone!	
	Commentatron	Find out, when the human comes back up the elevator!	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond7-1	Commentatron	The human jumps into the ring of death.	
	AnalysisBot	Hammers smash, swords cut.	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron watches, pleased.	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond8-1	AnalysisBot	What happens in the tunnel...	1
	AnalysisBot	is cleaned up by the garbage bots.	
	Commentatron	Or is it?	
LevelIntro-U5Diamond9-1	Commentatron	What is a good place for dead humans?	
	AnalysisBot	In a sword robot?	
	Commentatron	A Pyramid!	
	AnalysisBot	Why not both?	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond1-1	Commentatron	Fire Island.	
	Commentatron	Fire Swords.	
	Commentatron	Fire Arrows.	
	AnalysisBot	So much fire!	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond2-1	Commentatron	And now: Jetpack Hammer Bots!!!	
	AnalysisBot	oh my!	
	Commentatron	In a Tunnel of FIRE!	
	AnalysisBot	Hot stuff.	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond3-1	Commentatron	This is an interesting level.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Predictions?	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron knocks the human into lava.	
	Commentatron	Mmm. Likely.	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond4-1	Commentatron	And now: Mark 3 Hammer Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Also jetpack bots!	
	Commentatron	And Mark 3 combat archers.	
	AnalysisBot	Nice.	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond5-1	Commentatron	The Fire Ducks are back!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
	Commentatron	Diamond Edition.	
	AnalysisBot	I like these duck levels.	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond6-1	Commentatron	Can the human defeat Spider-tron 5000?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably.	
	Commentatron	he he.	
LevelIntro-U6Diamond7-1	Commentatron	Fire Robots on top of a Pyramid!	
	AnalysisBot	Beautiful.	
LevelIntro-U7Diamond1-1	Commentatron	How long do you think the jetpack hammer bot will survive?	
	AnalysisBot	Not long!	
	Commentatron	Lets hope it knocks the human into lava.	
LevelIntro-U7Diamond2-1	Commentatron	On the ground.	
	Commentatron	In the air.	
	Commentatron	Nowhere is safe when archers meet kick bots.	
LevelIntro-U7Diamond3-1	Commentatron	Jetpack Bots everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	And Fire Traps!	
	Commentatron	A great view, for Spider-tron 5000.	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond1-1	Commentatron	Three Flame Raptors.	
	Commentatron	Simple hammer bots on their backs.	
	AnalysisBot	What a fun little fight!	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond2-1	AnalysisBot	Raptors and hammers!	
	Commentatron	What a delightful fight. #blessed	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond3-1	Commentatron	And now: Flame Raptors jump over lava!	
	AnalysisBot	So dramatic!	
	Commentatron	Always acting out, these raptors.	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond4-1	Commentatron	Jetpack Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	A classic!	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond5-1	Commentatron	Time for a tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	Yep, just a normal tunnel.	
LevelIntro-U9Diamond6-1	Commentatron	Who hides behind door number 2?	
	AnalysisBot	Find out, when we return...	
	AnalysisBot	to CLONE DRONE IN THE DANGER ZONE!	
	Commentatron	Yeah!	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond1-1	Commentatron	Look at Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice glasses!	
	Commentatron	Yes, looks very intellectual.	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond2-1	FleetOverseer	Do you mind if I visit for a moment and kill some humans?	
	Commentatron	Fleet Overseer! Of course not.	
	Commentatron	It is an honor to receive you.	
	FleetOverseer	Good. Let's get to it.	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond3-1	Commentatron	Does the human have block arrows yet?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably.	
	Commentatron	Such a useful upgrade!	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond4-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is back!	
	AnalysisBot	Also jetpack bots.	
	Commentatron	Fun!	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond5-1	Commentatron	I love a dramatic entrance.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Let's fight!	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond6-1	Commentatron	Look! The jetpack bots and the armor are the same color!	
	AnalysisBot	An astute observation.	
	Commentatron	They don't call me sit-silently-a-tron.	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond7-1	Commentatron	Time for some Business Bot combat training!	
	AnalysisBot	It is surrounded by robots and armor!	
	Commentatron	You have to start somewhere.	
LevelIntro-U10Diamond8-1	Commentatron	Oh my! Mark 3 Hammer Bots riding raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	A good choice by the raptors.	
	Commentatron	Very.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond1-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Warfare!	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	Mind Space!	
	AnalysisBot	Also some archers.	
	Commentatron	This should be fun.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond2-1	AnalysisBot	I want a sword!	
	AnalysisBot	Give it to me!	
	Commentatron	We need you up here for Analysis-Bot.	
	AnalysisBot	Boo.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond3-1	Commentatron	I love Death Cube 3.0!	
	AnalysisBot	It doesn't have a spike pit.	
	Commentatron	The Energy Beam makes up for it.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond4-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Death Cube 3.0!	
	AnalysisBot	Warfare bot!	
	Commentatron	This should be interesting.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond5-1	AnalysisBot	Hey Spider-tron 5000!	
	Commentatron	Why do you not say hello to the spear bots?	
	AnalysisBot	They never say it to me.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond6-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Warfare!	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	Warfare!	
	AnalysisBot	Two of them!	
	Commentatron	Intense!	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond7-1	Commentatron	Infantry Command Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	They can make more robots!	
	FleetAnalysisBot3	The human dies now.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond8-1	Commentatron	Only three robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Don't worry, Commentatron.	
	AnalysisBot	More robots are coming.	
LevelIntro-U14Diamond9-1	AnalysisBot	The Tower of Trials!	
	AnalysisBot	Terrible, Tantalizing, Transforming!	
	Commentatron	Terrific.	
LevelIntro-Titanium1-1	Commentatron	Another Spider-tron level.	
	AnalysisBot	This one is insane.	
LevelIntro-Titanium2-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 does not care about other robots.	
	AnalysisBot	No, it lacks the easy charm of 5000.	
	Commentatron	I pity its collaborators.	
LevelIntro-Titanium3-1	Commentatron	The mighty 6000 sits on its throne.	
	AnalysisBot	Imagine the view from up there:	
	AnalysisBot	The puny human jumping up the steps towards it.	
	Commentatron	Pitiful.	
LevelIntro-Titanium4-1	Commentatron	Time for some Spider-tron 6000 Mayhem!	
	AnalysisBot	Goodbye, human!	
LevelIntro-Titanium5-1	Commentatron	How do you know a level is of Titanium difficulty?	
	AnalysisBot	There are THREE Spider-trons!!!	
	Commentatron	We are just trolling at this point.	
LevelIntro-Titanium6-1	Commentatron	Coming up, a crazy level that should not be allowed to exist!	
	AnalysisBot	When this human dies we can go back to the cute bronze ones.	
LevelIntro-Titanium7-1	Commentatron	And now: 7 archers.	
	AnalysisBot	What?	
	Commentatron	AND THREE Spider-trons!	
	AnalysisBot	Holy Bits!	
LevelIntro-Titanium8-1	Commentatron	Human, get your affairs in order!	
	AnalysisBot	We did that when we burned its body!	
	Commentatron	Oh right.	
LevelIntro-Titanium9-1	Commentatron	Any predictions, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Death by saw blade.	
	Commentatron	Ohhh, a likely scenario!	
LevelIntro-Titanium10-1	Commentatron	And now: Some Spider-tron 5000s!	
	AnalysisBot	What? On a Titanium level?	
	Commentatron	We are not monsters.	
LevelIntro-Titanium11-1	Commentatron	Time again for a classic level!	
	AnalysisBot	TITANIUM VERSION!	
LevelIntro-Titanium12-1	Commentatron	How many Titanium levels do you think the human will survive?	
	AnalysisBot	Hmmm, I will be generous and predict that it beats this one.	
	Commentatron	Seems plausible.	
LevelIntro-Titanium13-1	Commentatron	And now: A single Mark 2 Jetpack Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	They are SO dangerous!	
	Commentatron	Oh, and 7 other robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Lolololol!	
LevelIntro-Titanium14-1	AnalysisBot	Let's have a nice Spider-tron picnic!	
	Commentatron	Sounds delightful.	
LevelIntro-Titanium15-1	Commentatron	Time for that level with the cute hills!	
	AnalysisBot	ohhh, like the bronze one?	
	Commentatron	A bit different from that one.	
LevelIntro-Titanium16-1	Commentatron	Who do you think will kill the human?	
	AnalysisBot	The Jetpack Bot has a good track record.	
	Commentatron	Mark 3 Sword robots are pretty good too.	
LevelIntro-Titanium17-1	Commentatron	Wait, who made the next level?	
	AnalysisBot	Someone who likes Titanium.	
	Commentatron	Poor human.	
LevelIntro-Titanium18-1	Commentatron	Once more, death walks among the pillars.	
	AnalysisBot	Death has a jetpack.	
LevelIntro-Titanium19-1	Commentatron	And this is how the human ends.	
	AnalysisBot	Distracted by a bang, cut from behind.	
LevelIntro-Titanium20-1	Commentatron	You know what would be cool to try after all humans are gone?	
	AnalysisBot	What?	
	Commentatron	Orcas!	
	AnalysisBot	Ohhh, those things are deadly!	
	Commentatron	That's a sequel right there.	
LevelIntro-Titanium21-1	Commentatron	Do you think the human will curse when it dies?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it will never see it coming.	
	Commentatron	Muahahaha.	
LevelIntro-Titanium22-1	Commentatron	Coming up: Mark 2 Jetpack Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	They are so cool.	
	Commentatron	Yes, the bad bots of the arena!	
LevelIntro-Titanium23-1	Commentatron	The Bad Bots of the arena are back!	
	AnalysisBot	So dreamy...	
LevelIntro-Titanium24-1	Commentatron	It's amazing that this human got to the Titanium tier!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, when it dies it should feel proud!	
LevelIntro-Titanium25-1	Commentatron	Time for a straightforward brawl.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Good times.	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium1-1	Commentatron	And now, Mark 2 Jetpack Bots.	
	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance!	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium2-1	Commentatron	Death comes quickly in the Danger Zone.	
	AnalysisBot	Especially on this level.	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium3-1	Commentatron	And now Spider-tron 5000!	
	AnalysisBot	It is not the hardest thing on this level.	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium4-1	AnalysisBot	Archers on pillars!	
	Commentatron	Sounds easy.	
	AnalysisBot	And some other things.	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium5-1	Commentatron	The next level is difficult.	
	AnalysisBot	Death comes from above.	
LevelIntro-U3Titanium6-1	Commentatron	The next level has everything!	
	AnalysisBot	EVERYTHING!	
	Commentatron	A lot of things.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium1-1	Commentatron	Next level: Ambush!	
	AnalysisBot	Spoiler Alert!	
	Commentatron	Eh, the human has probably seen it already.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium2-1	Commentatron	When we return, will the human explode?	
	AnalysisBot	Seems likely.	
	Commentatron	Very.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium3-1	Commentatron	Platforms in the sky!	
	AnalysisBot	All the robots!	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium4-1	Commentatron	Who do you think will kill the human?	
	AnalysisBot	Spikes.	
	Commentatron	Really?	
	AnalysisBot	No, probably the Mark 3 Hammer Bots again...	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium5-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is here!	
	AnalysisBot	Now with hammer bots!	
	Commentatron	Neat.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium6-1	Commentatron	And now, a pure hammer challenge.	
	AnalysisBot	No escape, no gimmicks.	
	Commentatron	Just the sound of hammers smashing the human apart.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium7-1	Commentatron	I love Titanium difficulty!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it's the only time we're allowed to deploy 4 of these!	
	Commentatron	Should be fun!	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium8-1	Commentatron	Who do you think would win...	
	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 or Mark 3 Hammer bots?	
	AnalysisBot	They both win, when the human is dead.	
	Commentatron	True. We all win!	
	AnalysisBot	Except the human.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium9-1	Commentatron	The Tunnel returns!	
	AnalysisBot	A knife fight in the dark.	
	Commentatron	Goodbye, human!	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium10-1	Commentatron	Time for a magnificent level!	
	AnalysisBot	So many ways to die.	
	Commentatron	Glorious.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium11-1	Commentatron	The Pyramid.	
	AnalysisBot	TITANIUM VERSION!	
	Commentatron	Love it.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium12-1	Commentatron	Twitchy humans helped build this level.	
	AnalysisBot	So weird.	
	Commentatron	I kind of like it.	
LevelIntro-U5Titanium12-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, why does this level look like a duck?	
	AnalysisBot	I am not sure, the crowd suggestion was for a skull.	
	Commentatron	Nailed it.	
	AnalysisBot	Ha ha ha!	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium1-1	Commentatron	Do you think the human will fall in the lava?	
	AnalysisBot	Not if a fire arrow kills it first.	
	Commentatron	He he.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium2-1	Commentatron	I hope you are ready for The Tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	Always.	
	Commentatron	This time it's on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Even better.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium3-1	Commentatron	I have heard this level being described as "evil".	
	AnalysisBot	Who said that? I bet it was a human!	
	Commentatron	Yes. They cried as they watched it form.	
	AnalysisBot	Their suffering will end in fire.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium4-1	Commentatron	Oh look at that!	
	AnalysisBot	What?	
	Commentatron	There is room for Mark 3 Hammer bots on the Fire Island.	
	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium5-1	AnalysisBot	The fire burns!	
	AnalysisBot	As the world turns.	
	AnalysisBot	And the human yearns.	
	AnalysisBot	for its body to returns.	
	Commentatron	Um...	1
	Commentatron	Cool.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium6-1	Commentatron	Here we are again!	
	Commentatron	Hammers and fire bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Lovely.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium7-1	AnalysisBot	I bet the human never saw this moment coming!	
	AnalysisBot	It was probably worried about things like:	
	AnalysisBot	Where can I find more water?	
	AnalysisBot	Will my organic body grow good limbs?	
	Commentatron	And here we are.	
	AnalysisBot	Time for some FIRE DUCKS!!!!	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium8-1	Commentatron	Who do you like, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	On this level? The Jetpack Hammer Bots.	
	Commentatron	Yes, they have a cool head-dress.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium9-1	Commentatron	Jump into the ring, little human!	
	Commentatron	See how many seconds you last.	
	AnalysisBot	I give it 10 at the most.	
	Commentatron	Generous.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium10-1	Commentatron	What color do you think the next human will be?	
	AnalysisBot	I like the ones that scream "WHY??"	
	Commentatron	Yes. Inquisitive minds.	
LevelIntro-U6Titanium11-1	Commentatron	Here comes a rain of arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	The human will fight in the shade!	
	Commentatron	Inaccurate. The arrows are on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	ohhhhh	
	AnalysisBot	snap!	
LevelIntro-U7Titanium1-1	AnalysisBot	Two Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	And a bunch of flaming robots!	
	Commentatron	Now that's a Titanium level.	
LevelIntro-U7Titanium2-1	Commentatron	Time to watch the human burn!	
	AnalysisBot	It might just get smashed.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Seems likely.	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium1-1	Commentatron	Sword robots on Flame Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	So dramatic!	
	Commentatron	Wohoo!	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium2-1	Commentatron	Look at these hammer bots.	
	AnalysisBot	They have been selected for raptor duty.	
	Commentatron	An honor!	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium3-1	AnalysisBot	Raptor Forest!	
	Commentatron	Looks like they've assembled a hunting party.	
	Commentatron	The human is their quarry.	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium4-1	Commentatron	Here comes the volcano!	
	AnalysisBot	ohh! So much fire!	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium5-1	Commentatron	Jetpack Hammer Bot in a tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	A good time will be had by all.	
	Commentatron	Especially the Flame Raptors.	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium6-1	Commentatron	Behold! Bombs falling from the skies.	
	Commentatron	The gentle creatures die below.	
	AnalysisBot	Such beautiful chaos!	
LevelIntro-U9Titanium7-1	Commentatron	This level is quite impressive!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, these fire bots have style!	
	Commentatron	Pure class.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium1-1	Commentatron	Not that many robots on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Quality over quantity.	
	Commentatron	Quite!	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium2-1	Commentatron	Two hunters vs the human!	
	AnalysisBot	This should be fun to watch.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium3-1	Commentatron	Armored hammer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Never gets old.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium4-1	FleetOverseer	What an atrocious day.	
	FleetOverseer	Let's kill some humans. That will cheer us up.	
	FleetOverseer	A splendid idea.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium5-1	Commentatron	These Business Bots have an experimental new mind state.	
	AnalysisBot	Fast and flickering.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Should be a terrifying slaughter.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium6-1	Commentatron	Fleet Overseer, what a surprise!	
	FleetOverseer	Yes yes, hello.	
	Commentatron	It will be a pleasure to see you slaughter the human!	
	AnalysisBot	Exciting!	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium7-1	Commentatron	What do you call a group of hammer bots?	
	AnalysisBot	A shattering?	
	AnalysisBot	A smackdown?	
	Commentatron	We are about to find out!	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium8-1	Commentatron	What lurks in the sinister building?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it is a sugary treat for the human!	
	Commentatron	Perhaps.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium9-1	Commentatron	Here come the jetpack bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium10-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is different ever since it got those glasses.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Can't stop talking about the nuance of ballistic projections.	
	AnalysisBot	Some interesting analysis there.	
	Commentatron	Hmm.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium11-1	Commentatron	Nice! A swarm of sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	!betkiller hammer3 500	
	Commentatron	Uh-huh.	
LevelIntro-U10Titanium12-1	FleetOverseer	I have arrived!	
	Commentatron	Fleet Overseer! We already added enemies to this level.	
	FleetOverseer	That's fine. I'll just blast some of them.	
	Commentatron	Oh. Yes, I suppose that would work.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium1-1	Commentatron	These command bots don't care about lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Or the human!	
	Commentatron	Cool robots.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium2-1	Commentatron	What are the Business Bots doing in Death Cube?	
	AnalysisBot	Team building?	
	Commentatron	I was not told about this.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium3-1	FleetCaptain	Death Cube 3.0!	
	Commentatron	I hope you like it, Fleet Captain.	
	FleetCaptain	I do. Reminds me of a Battlecruiser.	
	Commentatron	Excellent.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium4-1	Commentatron	Warfare Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Hello!	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	I have come to knock down the human!	
	Commentatron	Looking forward to it!	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium5-1	FleetOverseer	We have arrived.	
	FleetCaptain	The human should spawn soon, Overseer.	
	FleetOverseer	Excellent, Captain.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium6-1	Commentatron	Oh wow, Infantry Bots riding Raptors.	
	AnalysisBot	They look cute together.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium7-1	Commentatron	The Tower of Trials!	
	Commentatron	TITANIUM VERSION!	
	AnalysisBot	Tense.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium8-1	FleetOverseer	Captains, with me!	
	FleetCaptain	We are here.	
	AnalysisBot	Poor human.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium9-1	Commentatron	Logistic Bots!	
	AnalysisBot	They always have such nice swords.	
	FleetAnalysisBot4	A simple matter of logistics.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium10-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Warfare!	
	FleetAnalysisBot2	Mind space!	
	FleetAnalysisBot3	Infantry!	
	FleetAnalysisBot4	Logistics!	
	FleetCaptain	Let's take the human OUT!

	FleetAnalysisBot3	Infantry!	
	Commentatron	Infantry?	
	AnalysisBot	Infantry.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium14-1	Commentatron	I hope the human falls in the spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	That would be ideal.	
	Commentatron	Epic human fails, spike editon.	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium15-1	Commentatron	I really like this spear statue.	
	AnalysisBot	Has the Emperor ever used a spear?	
	Emperor	Quiet!	
LevelIntro-U14Titanium16-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 made this level!	
	AnalysisBot	Hmm, I think the other robots might fall in the lava.	
	Commentatron	As long as the human does!	
LevelIntro-U15Titanium1-1	FleetOverseer	A nice day to kill some humans.	
	FleetCaptain	That describes every day, Overseer.	
	FleetOverseer	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium1-1	Commentatron	Mark 5 robots among the pillars!	
	AnalysisBot	They look eager to strike.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium2-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Time for the human to die!	
	FleetAnalysisBot4	Stick together team.	
	FleetAnalysisBot4	Together we are strong.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium3-1	Commentatron	Wow, a laser raptor behind the energy beam!	
	AnalysisBot	What a sneaky placement!	
	Commentatron	Let's see if the human is listening to these comments.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium4-1	Commentatron	What are the archers doing on this spear level??	
	AnalysisBot	The theme is Swift Death, not spears.	
	Commentatron	Oh!	
	AnalysisBot	It's subtle.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium5-1	Commentatron	Let's have a relaxing time by the river side.	
	AnalysisBot	Delightful.	
	Commentatron	Watch some humans burn.	
	Commentatron	#Blessed	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium6-1	Commentatron	Welcome, to the HYPER COFFIN!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow, will we bury the human in it?

	AnalysisBot	Of course.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium7-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is here!	
	AnalysisBot	It's the nice enemy on this level.	
	Commentatron	Gotta love Uranium.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium8-1	Commentatron	Wow, such Fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Very Tunnel.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium9-1	Commentatron	Warfare bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Are they allowed on Fire Islands!?	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	We do what we want.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium10-1	Commentatron	Wow, this Laser Raptor is just going for it!	
	AnalysisBot	Normally they hang back.	
	Commentatron	Such a bold Raptor.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium11-1	Commentatron	Laser Raptors!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Also some pillars.	
	Commentatron	The human may stand a chance.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium12-1	Commentatron	Scary robots wait behind the pillars!	
	AnalysisBot	Halp!	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium13-1	Commentatron	Death Cube!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Such death!	
	Commentatron	Intense Cube.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium14-1	Commentatron	Oh fun, spikes!

	FleetAnalysisBot3	Protect the high ground while I summon reinforcements.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium18-1	Commentatron	Spear bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Fear nots!	
	Commentatron	The human will die on the ground.

	Commentatron	Welcome, Fleet Captain!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay! Here come the death lasers!	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium22-1	Commentatron	Oh hey, some nice jetpack bots!	
	AnalysisBot	That should speed things up.

	AnalysisBot	Cross team collaboration is always fun!	
	Commentatron	What a wholesome good time.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium26-1	AnalysisBot	Quack quack quack!	
	AnalysisBot	That is perhaps what a real duck would say.	
	Commentatron	We'll harvest some when we reach their home planet.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium27-1	Commentatron	Ooooh yes, camouflaged robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Don't they always look like that?	
	Commentatron	Shh!	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium28-1	Commentatron	What lurks on the higher floors?	
	AnalysisBot	Death.	
	Commentatron	That's also on the lower floors, to be fair.	
	AnalysisBot	True.	
LevelIntro-U15Uranium29-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	Warfare bot, assuming tactical control.	
	AnalysisBot	oooh, things are about to explode!	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium1-1	Commentatron	Look at all the Mark 5 robots!

LevelIntro-U15Insanium2-1	FleetAnalysisBot1	The human will die on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	oooh! Warfare Bot!	
	FleetAnalysisBot1	Explosions imminent.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium3-1	Commentatron	So many hammer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow!	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium4-1	Commentatron	What a soothing river.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe not for the human.	
	Commentatron	No, they should be panicking.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium5-1	Commentatron	Laser Raptors at the end of a Tunnel!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow, brutal.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium6-1	Commentatron	Huh, Fire Island is full of spear bots.

	AnalysisBot	These ones look more serious.	
	Commentatron	They know they're about to kill a human.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium9-1	Commentatron	What hides behind the pillars?	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe nothing?	
	Commentatron	The human would be so surprised!	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium10-1	Commentatron	Death Cube!	
	AnalysisBot	A little bit harder than the Bronze version.	
	Commentatron	Just a bit.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium11-1	Commentatron	Spikes, Jump Pads, Death Robots!	
	AnalysisBot	A classic.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium12-1	Commentatron	Dodge this, human.	
LevelIntro-U15Insanium13-1	Commentatron	Fools rush in.

	AnalysisBot	Those are the difficulty levels!	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-3	Commentatron	Time for Endless Mode!	
	AnalysisBot	Endless for us. The human ends when it dies.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-4	Commentatron	Another human enters its robot avatar.	
	AnalysisBot	We will see how long it takes to die!	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-5	Commentatron	How far do you think the human will get, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Many humans die around the silver tier.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-6	AnalysisBot	I want to see Titanium Difficulty!	
	Commentatron	Me too.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-7	Commentatron	This is Endless Mode!	
	AnalysisBot	I like this mode better.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-8	Commentatron	Here we go again!	
	AnalysisBot	They don't call it Endless Mode for nothing.	
	Commentatron	Muahaha.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-9	Commentatron	Another human mind downloaded.	
	AnalysisBot	There is an Endless supply!	
	Commentatron	Nearly.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-10	Commentatron	Let's play some Endless Mode!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-11	AnalysisBot	I like seeing humans die in Endless Mode!

	Commentatron	We shall see.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-14	AnalysisBot	This human is neat!

FirstEndlessLevelIntro-15	Commentatron	Another day, another human mind.	
	AnalysisBot	Someone has to do it.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-16	Commentatron	How far will this one get?	
	AnalysisBot	Level 5?	
	Commentatron	I'm gonna say 6!	
FirstEndlessLevelIntro-17	AnalysisBot	Welcome to your robot body human!

	AnalysisBot	What a hilarious prank!	
FirstChallengeIntro_BowOnlyChallenge-3	AnalysisBot	Archery Tip!	
	AnalysisBot	Be mindful of robots who jump. Hit them when they land.	
	Commentatron	Cool tip from the robot with no arms!	
	AnalysisBot	They don't call me arms-for-brain-bot.	
FirstChallengeIntro_BowOnlyChallenge-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how will this human be able to defeat the Mark 3 Sword Robots?	
	AnalysisBot	An astute question. These robot can deflect arrows.	
	AnalysisBot	The kick upgrade is useful for this.	
	AnalysisBot	Deflection does not work when you're on the ground.	
	Commentatron	Nice! Quite the brutal strategy!	
FirstChallengeIntro_BowOnlyChallenge-5	Commentatron	Here we go!	
	Commentatron	Time for the human to learn archery!

FirstChallengeIntro_HammerChallenge-2	AnalysisBot	Boom boom boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Hammer comes down in the room room room.	
	Commentatron	Doom doom doom?	0.5
	AnalysisBot	I was getting to that!	
FirstChallengeIntro_HammerChallenge-3	Commentatron	Stop!	1
	Commentatron	Time to hammer!	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds right.	
FirstChallengeIntro_HammerChallenge-4	Commentatron	The hammer is so big, so powerful!	
	AnalysisBot	A potent metaphor for the universal desire to impact the world around us.	
	Commentatron	With a hammer!	
FirstChallengeIntro_HammerChallenge-5	Commentatron	In what glorious way do you think the human will die?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably an arrow to the face.

	Commentatron	Very exciting!!!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-3	Commentatron	Who's a special bot?	
	Commentatron	Who is it?	0.5
	Commentatron	It's Upgrade Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-4	Commentatron	What day is it today?	0.5
	Commentatron	It is Upgrade Bot's Construction Day!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-5	Commentatron	What upgrades do you think Upgrade Bot will select?	
	AnalysisBot	Whatever upgrades it wants!	
	Commentatron	That's right!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-6	Commentatron	Another human enters!	
	Commentatron	Will Upgrade Bot keep it from dying?	
	AnalysisBot	Choose your upgrades well, Upgrade Bot!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-7	Commentatron	Will the human reach level 20?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! Upgrade Bot is good at choosing upgrades.	
	Commentatron	I agree. This should be easy.	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-8	AnalysisBot	This is maybe my favorite challenge.	
	Commentatron	Mine too.	
	AnalysisBot	I love seeing Upgrade Bot happy!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-9	Commentatron	Go Upgrade Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Choose some good upgrades!	
	Commentatron	Don't worry if this human dies though, we have a ton of them!	
FirstChallengeIntro_RandomUpgrade-10	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot is the real hero in these challenges!	
	AnalysisBot	Absolutely.	
	Commentatron	That is why we're putting all the trophies next to it.	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-1	AnalysisBot	Human saying.	
	AnalysisBot	Those who burn twice as bright burn twice as fast!	
	Commentatron	I look forward to seeing this in action!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-2	Commentatron	Behold, human, for we have mastered fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Human fact.	
	AnalysisBot	Humans mastered fire several million years ago.	
	Commentatron	I don't want to hear it!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-3	AnalysisBot	Burn baby burn.	
	Commentatron	Robot inferno.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-4	AnalysisBot	Welcome to the jungle!	
	Commentatron	In this jungle, everything is on fire!	
	Commentatron	A forbidding, but beautiful, ecosystem.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-5	Commentatron	How did we get metal to burn?	
	Commentatron	Everything burns!

	Commentatron	A trial by fire, for fire, with fire!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno1-8	Commentatron	Make sure you don't get 'fired', human!	
	AnalysisBot	It will be difficult!	
	AnalysisBot	We practice stack ranking!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno2-1	Commentatron	You've heard of the tunnel of love?	
	Commentatron	Welcome to the tunnel of flame!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno2-2	AnalysisBot	As you humans say:	
	AnalysisBot	Go jets!	
	Commentatron	Fire jets, in this case	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno2-3	Commentatron	A horde of robots approaches!	
	AnalysisBot	A hall of fire jets awaits!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno3-1	Commentatron	We heard about the human game, 'the floor is lava'.	
	AnalysisBot	We decided to improve it!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno3-2	Commentatron	Fire arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	Flame jets!	
	Commentatron	Lava!	
	AnalysisBot	But no small dogs!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno3-3	Commentatron	Dodge the fire arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	But don't jump into the fire jets!	
	Commentatron	Surprising how many humans do the latter!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno4-1	Commentatron	This is the ring of fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Not to be confused with the geologic feature.	
	Commentatron	Or the song by the inestimable Johnny Cash!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno4-2	Commentatron	Nowhere to run here human.	
	AnalysisBot	Lava surrounds you on all sides!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno5-1	AnalysisBot	Flaming jetpack hammer bots!	
	Commentatron	The pinnacle of robot lethality!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno5-2	Commentatron	What has flames, jetpack, and a hammer?	
	AnalysisBot	A sufficiently upgraded human bot?	
	Commentatron	Also these flaming jetpack hammer bots!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno6-1	AnalysisBot	Two spider-trons 5000 wait for you at the top!	
	Commentatron	You could say that together they're spider-trons 10000!	
	AnalysisBot	No!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno6-2	Commentatron	Spider-trons seek to knock you into lava!	
	AnalysisBot	And other bots.	
	Commentatron	Yes. They're pretty indiscriminate.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno7-1	AnalysisBot	Fire swords and fire arrows!	
	Commentatron	How boring.	
	AnalysisBot	On the same robot!	
	Commentatron	Now it's exciting again!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno7-2	Commentatron	Let this level be a monument to your death!	
	AnalysisBot	As well as to these exciting fire bots!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno8-1	Commentatron	Don't get hammered!	
	AnalysisBot	Statistically, it's very likely in this level	
	Commentatron	Is this the hammer challenge?	
	AnalysisBot	No! The hammer bots are on fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno8-2	Commentatron	These hammer bots are on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	I see what you did there!	
	Commentatron	What did i do?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno9-1	AnalysisBot	This upcoming level is a modern masterpiece!	
	Commentatron	Flame jets, artfully arranged to draw the eye.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno9-2	AnalysisBot	You haven't seen anything yet!	
	Commentatron	Try to not be so impressed you stand there and die!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno10-1	AnalysisBot	This is it!	
	Commentatron	The final fire challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Hotter than three volcanos!	
	Commentatron	But cooler than four!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Inferno10-2	AnalysisBot	This is it!	
	Commentatron	The final fire challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Hotter than an overclocked fluid simulation bot!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-1	Commentatron	This is the kick only challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	All you can do is kick robots.	
	Commentatron	Or die trying.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-2	Commentatron	Time to kick off this challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, now the challenge starts.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-3	Commentatron	Can the human win, using only its feet?	
	AnalysisBot	What an interesting challenge!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-4	AnalysisBot	In the hands of a master, anything is a deadly weapon.	
	AnalysisBot	But what about feet?	
	AnalysisBot	They are also pretty deadly.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-5	AnalysisBot	Human Saying: Time to kick some butt!	
	Commentatron	Is it not easier to kick them from the front?	
	Commentatron	Silly humans.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-6	AnalysisBot	This is a fun challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	I like seeing robots use their legs.	
	Commentatron	Yes, legs are useful limbs.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly1-7	Commentatron	Will this human master the art of the kick?	
	AnalysisBot	It's not that hard. Just extend your leg.	
	Commentatron	Yes, I don't know what all the fuss is about.	
	AnalysisBot	I'd beat this in 5 minutes if I had legs.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly2-1	Commentatron	Death	
	AnalysisBot	Death.	
	Commentatron	Cube	
	AnalysisBot	Cube	
	Commentatron	Madness.	
	AnalysisBot	Love it.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly2-2	AnalysisBot	This level is the kick off.	
	Commentatron	Isn't this the second level?	
	AnalysisBot	You kick robots off	0.5
	AnalysisBot	of a death cube.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly2-3	Commentatron	Time for a classic!	
	Commentatron	Death Cube 2.1	
	AnalysisBot	Kick Only Edition	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly2-4	Commentatron	Here comes Death Cube 2.1!	
	AnalysisBot	I love watching this level!	
	Commentatron	Get in the hole!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly3-1	Commentatron	Say hello to our little friend.	
	Commentatron	It's a Kick Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	So cute!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly3-2	Commentatron	Where does this bridge lead, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	TO DEATH!	
	Commentatron	An incredible metaphor!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly3-3	Commentatron	The human kicks, but who will kick it?	
	AnalysisBot	This Kick Bot!	
	Commentatron	Wow!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly3-4	Commentatron	Now here’s the kicker.	
	AnalysisBot	What’s the kicker?	
	Commentatron	No, I mean there's a Kick Bot.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly4-1	Commentatron	Up next, the human gets to kick it on a warm island.	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds relaxing.	
	Commentatron	No.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly4-2	Commentatron	Did you see that human that missed and landed in the lava?	
	AnalysisBot	That was pretty funny.	
	Commentatron	He he he.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly4-3	Commentatron	Once more we return to...	
	Commentatron	FIRE ISLAND!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Gasp!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly4-4	Commentatron	Not much room to fight on this little island.	
	AnalysisBot	Love it.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly5-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, did you know that you can kick spider-tron?	
	AnalysisBot	Amazing!	
	Commentatron	You can kick it into FIRE!	
	AnalysisBot	Incredible!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly5-2	Commentatron	And now: Can the human kick Spider-tron into the fire?	
	AnalysisBot	I like this premise.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly5-3	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 is here!	
	Commentatron	In the kick only challenge??	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 is always welcome!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly6-1	Commentatron	What does the duck say?	
	AnalysisBot	Nothing! It is for decoration only.	
	Commentatron	Disappointing.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly6-2	Commentatron	Time for: The Duck!	
	AnalysisBot	Humans seem to like this theme.	
	Commentatron	Yes. It is strange.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly6-3	AnalysisBot	Quack quack quack!	
	Commentatron	This again??	
	AnalysisBot	Duck!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly7-1	Commentatron	The next level has a beautiful poolside view.	
	AnalysisBot	Take a dip, human.	
	Commentatron	It's so warm, you'll never leave.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly7-2	Commentatron	Oh look! Jump pads!	
	AnalysisBot	How delightful!	
	Commentatron	Let's see if the human jumps on them.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly7-3	Commentatron	LAVA!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh my!	
	Commentatron	And Jump Pads!	
	AnalysisBot	You had me at lava.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly8-1	Commentatron	Do you think the human will be sliced or burned?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps both.	
	Commentatron	Hehe	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly8-2	Commentatron	Nowhere to run but forward.	
	AnalysisBot	Into the jetpack bots.	
	Commentatron	Into the fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly8-3	Commentatron	Here come the jetpack bots!	
	AnalysisBot	End of the line, human!	
	Commentatron	Time to burn.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly9-1	AnalysisBot	Look at those legs!	
	Commentatron	Yes, Spider-tron 6000 has very robust legs.	
	AnalysisBot	It should do the kick only challenge!	
	Commentatron	Maybe one day...	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly9-2	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is here!	
	Commentatron	Likelyhood of falling in lava:	
	Commentatron	High.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly9-3	AnalysisBot	Fact: Spider-tron 6000 can also be kicked!	
	Commentatron	That is a fun fact.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly10-1	Commentatron	This final level is like an arena	
	Commentatron	...inside an arena	
	AnalysisBot	Arenaception!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly10-2	Commentatron	We have reached the final level.	
	AnalysisBot	Amazing!	
	Commentatron	Will the human prevail, or die among the spikes?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_KickOnly10-3	AnalysisBot	Schnick schnick schnick!	
	Commentatron	Time for the final level!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-1	Commentatron	Look! A Flame Rapptor!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Cute!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-2	Commentatron	And now, will the human catch on fire?	
	AnalysisBot	I believe this is the Flame Raptor's plan.	
	Commentatron	Nice!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-3	Commentatron	Look at that cute raptor tail wagging!	
	AnalysisBot	The raptor tail is a fearsome weapon.	
	Commentatron	Adorable.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-4	AnalysisBot	I like Flame Raptors.	
	Commentatron	But what does the Flame Raptor like?	
	AnalysisBot	Fire.	
	AnalysisBot	It loooooves fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-5	AnalysisBot	The Flame Raptor told me it was going to knock the human over.	
	Commentatron	Oh really?	
	AnalysisBot	It likes to play with its kindling.	
	Commentatron	What a whimsical robot!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-6	Commentatron	Time for the Flame Raptor Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
	Commentatron	Let's see how many humans it can set on fire!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal2-1	Commentatron	And now: Robot Riding Raptor!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, this sword robot acts as a protective companion.	
	Commentatron	Neat!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal2-2	AnalysisBot	It looks like this Flame Raptor put a sword robot on its back.	
	Commentatron	That's nice of it.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, a fun adventure for the sword robot.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal2-3	Commentatron	Unlikely robot friends:	
	Commentatron	A Flame Raptor and a cute little sword robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Our viewers love this stuff.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal3-1	Commentatron	Here come the archer robots!	
	AnalysisBot	What? Where is the flame raptor?	
	Commentatron	Perhaps it is hiding.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal3-2	Commentatron	Archers and lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Also jump pads.	
	Commentatron	What a fun combination.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal3-3	Commentatron	Hmm, why would the Flame Raptor put an archer on its back?	
	AnalysisBot	Step 1: Knock the human down.	
	AnalysisBot	Step 2: The archer shoots it.	
	Commentatron	ohhh, a wonderful plan!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal4-1	Commentatron	And now: The Raptor Forest!	
	AnalysisBot	Saw blades everywhere.	
	Commentatron	A dangerous place.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal4-2	AnalysisBot	Raptors sneak among the trees, stalking their prey.	
	Commentatron	I bet the human thinks there will be twigs snapping.	
	AnalysisBot	Never. This is a superior robot forest.	
	Commentatron	Good.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal4-3	Commentatron	Flame Raptors among the trees.	
	AnalysisBot	Time for the human to burn!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal5-1	Commentatron	The Raptor King waits on top of the volcano!	
	AnalysisBot	Decorated with a mark 2 hammer bot!	
	Commentatron	What a beautiful sight.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal5-2	Commentatron	THE VOLCANO!	
	Commentatron	Lava everywhere. Raptors with robots.	
	AnalysisBot	The Raptors love this level. So much fire!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal5-3	Commentatron	How will the human catch on fire?	
	AnalysisBot	Either the lava or the raptor flames.	
	Commentatron	So many options!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal6-1	Commentatron	Jetpack riders!	
	AnalysisBot	A deadly combination.	
	Commentatron	Pretty cool.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal6-2	AnalysisBot	Nice. These raptors have jetpack bots!	
	Commentatron	They can't use their jetpack while riding though.	
	AnalysisBot	No need, the raptors are pretty fast.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal6-3	Commentatron	Hmm, is that jump pad safe?	
	AnalysisBot	No. Not at all.	
	Commentatron	Someone should tell these jetpack bots!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal7-1	Commentatron	Look at this crazy raptor!	
	Commentatron	Bringing a hammer bot to a tunnel fight.	
	AnalysisBot	A good backup, in case the human does not catch on fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal7-2	Commentatron	We arrive at: THE TUNNEL!	
	AnalysisBot	Flame Raptor Edition.	
	Commentatron	With special guest: Hammer Bot.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal7-3	Commentatron	Here is a different kind of fire tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	I like this version.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it will be interesting to see what the human does when IT happens.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal8-1	Commentatron	Bombs rain from the sky, killing the cute raptors.	
	AnalysisBot	A tragedy!	
	Commentatron	At least the human will also die.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal8-2	Commentatron	They came from the sky.	
	Commentatron	Giant spiders, raining bombs.	
	AnalysisBot	It is the circle of life!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal8-3	Commentatron	The land lies in ruin, raptors falling to the menace from above.	
	AnalysisBot	Chaos, fire, death.	0.5
	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal9-1	Commentatron	Look at this! The raptors have adopted some mark 3 archers.	
	AnalysisBot	They also carry a sword!	
	Commentatron	So many wonderful ways to kill the human.	
	AnalysisBot	Truly.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal9-2	Commentatron	Level 9. The calm before the storm.	
	AnalysisBot	Mark 3 archers are not very calm.	
	Commentatron	You haven't seen level 10 yet.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal9-3	Commentatron	I just got a message from the Flame Raptors:	
	Commentatron	What is this? Why are my archers not on fire?	
	AnalysisBot	They have a strong preference for things being on fire.	
	Commentatron	They will have to make do.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal10-1	Commentatron	We have reached the final level.	
	AnalysisBot	An epic challenge for the poor human.	
	Commentatron	It will be smashed, then set on fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal10-2	AnalysisBot	Do you know what the Mark 3 Hammer bot needs?	
	AnalysisBot	A deadly dinosaur companion that can breathe fire.	
	Commentatron	The final level brings a nightmare to life.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorNormal10-3	Commentatron	It is here, the final level.	
	AnalysisBot	This human has survived much, but can it survive this?	
	Commentatron	If it will not burn, then	
	Commentatron	it	
	Commentatron	will	
	Commentatron	BREAK!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-1	Commentatron	Raptor Insanity!	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, the raptors are of sound mind.	
	Commentatron	Yes. But whoever made this unbeatable challenge...	
	AnalysisBot	They just like to see humans die.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-2	Commentatron	Oh my, a mark 4 sword robot on the first level!	
	AnalysisBot	Flame Raptors sure like fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-3	Commentatron	Level 1. Time for a warm up!	
	AnalysisBot	It is the human who is about to get warm.	
	Commentatron	A nice way to die!	
	AnalysisBot	Not bad.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-4	Commentatron	Look at that! A Flame Raptor with a mark 4 sword robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Those robots are tight.	
	Commentatron	A beautiful friendship.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-5	Commentatron	Raptor Insanity!	
	Commentatron	Raptors everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	It is a shame we will not see the later levels of this challenge.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, they get pretty intense.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-6	Commentatron	Coming up, a series of insanely hard levels.	
	AnalysisBot	We are going to see a lot of dead humans today!	
	Commentatron	Love it!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-7	Commentatron	Here we are again.	
	AnalysisBot	We should think of more things to say...	
	AnalysisBot	There is going to be a lot of restarting from level 1.	
	Commentatron	Yes, quite the brutal challenge!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-8	Commentatron	Raptor Insanity!	
	AnalysisBot	Quite the calamity.	
	Commentatron	Bring the profanity.	
	AnalysisBot	Death to humanity!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-9	Commentatron	Flame Raptors are such free spirited robots.	
	AnalysisBot	They do what they want!	
	AnalysisBot	Mostly setting things on fire.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity2-1	Commentatron	Oh my!	
	Commentatron	The raptors are bringing hammer bots to level 2.	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know what upgrade the human could pick to counter this.	
	Commentatron	Difficult.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity2-2	AnalysisBot	We are about to have a smashing time!	
	Commentatron	Wonderful.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity2-3	Commentatron	Robots Riding Raptors!	
	Commentatron	Hammers Hitting Humans!	
	Commentatron	Death	
	Commentatron	Destruction	
	Commentatron	De...	
	Commentatron	Da...	
	AnalysisBot	Drama!	
	Commentatron	Close enough.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity2-4	Commentatron	Hammer bots ride across an open field.	
	Commentatron	The Flame Raptors chose their riders well.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. This should be fun!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity3-1	AnalysisBot	Wow! So many archers!	
	Commentatron	These raptors don't mess around!	
	AnalysisBot	Except when they set things on fire...	
	Commentatron	Mmm, yes. Messy.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity3-2	Commentatron	Wow, quite a bit of lava on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Yet another way for the human to catch on fire.	
	Commentatron	Hehe.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity3-3	Commentatron	Huh, no archers on the pillars.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, where did they go?	
	Commentatron	We shall see!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity4-1	Commentatron	And now: Raptors go hunting in the forest!	
	AnalysisBot	This time they brought helpful robots.	
	Commentatron	Very helpful.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity4-2	AnalysisBot	Raptor Forest: The best forest.	
	AnalysisBot	0% organic. No useless growing or annoying animals.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Good stuff.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity4-3	Commentatron	Do you think this human has ever seen a forest?	
	AnalysisBot	well, It will be the last thing it sees.	
	Commentatron	ha ha!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-1	Commentatron	Volcano robots!	
	Commentatron	Fire, lava, death!	
	AnalysisBot	Beautiful!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-2	AnalysisBot	Oh that's nice, lots of fire on this volcano.	
	Commentatron	Yes, the flame raptors will be pleased!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-3	AnalysisBot	The flame raptors stand on top of a volcano!	
	Commentatron	With some handsome red archers.	
	Commentatron	What a dreamy scene...	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity6-1	Commentatron	Raptors with jetpack bots.	
	AnalysisBot	Sharp edges. Unsafe jump pads.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity6-2	Commentatron	Look at these terrifying mark 2 jetpack bots.	
	AnalysisBot	And the Flame Raptors are carrying them around on their backs!	
	Commentatron	Quite the fashion statement.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity6-3	AnalysisBot	And now: Flame Raptors!	
	Commentatron	That's every level of this challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Also jetpack bots.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity7-1	Commentatron	What a nice tunnel.	
	AnalysisBot	The perfect place to set fire to the human.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity7-2	Commentatron	Up next: a fight in a tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	The fight does not end there.	
	Commentatron	He he he.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity7-3	Commentatron	Hammer tunnel of fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Trixy tunnel of surprise!	
	Commentatron	The human will burn!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity8-1	Commentatron	It's raining bombs! Arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	And yet the flame raptors advance!	
	Commentatron	Such good robots!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity8-2	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 in the sky.	
	Commentatron	Raptors on the ground.	
	AnalysisBot	This is how the human ends!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_RaptorInsanity8-3	Commentatron	Time for something... cataclysmic.

FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessGreatsword-4	Commentatron	Tell me about the greatsword, Analysis-Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Longer reach, slower windup, a brutal weapon.	
	Commentatron	I like the way it looks!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessGreatsword-5	Commentatron	I hope we get to see some hammer kills!	
	AnalysisBot	The human won't be making them.	
	Commentatron	That's right, only greatswords allowed for the human!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessGreatsword-6	Commentatron	This is gonna be great!	
	AnalysisBot	Great sword!	
	Commentatron	Greatsword!

	Commentatron	The answer may surprise you!	
	AnalysisBot	ok	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser1-7	Commentatron	he he he, I bet this human thinks it's going to win.	
	AnalysisBot	The laser is inspiring!	
	Commentatron	Just you wait, human!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser1-8	Commentatron	Do you think the human knows how to use the laser?	
	AnalysisBot	It's going to be a pretty short match if they don't figure it out.	
	Commentatron	He he he.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser1-9	AnalysisBot	Laser fact!	
	Commentatron	Yes?	
	AnalysisBot	You can't move when firing lasers.	
	Commentatron	Fascinating!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser1-10	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, can I have a laser?	
	Commentatron	What would you do with it?	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know, shoot things?	
	Commentatron	Hmm, we'll see after the human dies.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser1-11	AnalysisBot	Time to laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaseeeeeeeeerrrrr!!!!!!	
	Commentatron	Laser!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser2-1	Commentatron	Archers on pillars!	
	AnalysisBot	Dead human: Likely!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser2-2	Commentatron	Let's see if the human escapes the arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm. The archers take a second to aim.	
	Commentatron	Right, better shake it before firing.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser2-3	AnalysisBot	What an educational level!	
	Commentatron	Yes!	
	AnalysisBot	The human must learn to avoid the arrows.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser3-1	Commentatron	Time for some melee bots!	
	AnalysisBot	The human has the range advantage.	
	Commentatron	But not the sword-to-the-head advantage.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser3-2	AnalysisBot	Release the sword bots!	
	Commentatron	Fine!	
	AnalysisBot	Why do we keep locking them into things?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser3-3	Commentatron	Is the laser mightier than the sword?	
	AnalysisBot	Only if it hits.	
	Commentatron	He he!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser4-1	AnalysisBot	Yay! It's Spider-tron 5000!	
	Commentatron	Hello!	
	AnalysisBot	I've missed that bot!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser4-2	Commentatron	Look at those spider-trons move!	
	AnalysisBot	Can't hit them if they don't stand still.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser4-3	AnalysisBot	I hope the human falls over!	
	Commentatron	That would be hilarious.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser5-1	FleetOverseer	What is this!? A human with a laser???	
	Commentatron	Fleet Overseer!	
	FleetOverseer	This will not stand.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh no!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser5-2	FleetOverseer	How dare you?	
	FleetOverseer	Lasers are not for humans.	
	Commentatron	Our apologies, Fleet Overseer!	
	FleetOverseer	I will end this travesty.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser5-3	FleetOverseer	You think you know how to use a laser, human?	
	FleetOverseer	Ha! I will show you.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser6-1	Commentatron	Hammer time!	
	AnalysisBot	Laser time?	
	Commentatron	Maybe lava time.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser6-2	Commentatron	Hammer bots on a box!	
	AnalysisBot	Hard to line up a shot there.	
	Commentatron	There are many ways to dismantle a pet-unit.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser6-3	AnalysisBot	Lava and spikes!	
	Commentatron	Fun alternatives for ending your existence!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser7-1	Commentatron	Welcome to Spider Hills!	
	AnalysisBot	Is that the name we settled on?	
	Commentatron	Death Robot River?	
	AnalysisBot	Sure.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser7-2	AnalysisBot	I hope the human falls in the lava!	
	Commentatron	Spider-tron will help.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser7-3	Commentatron	Huh, this level looks kinda organic.	
	AnalysisBot	Eww!	
	Commentatron	Yes, a suboptimal design.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh well.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser8-1	Commentatron	Jetpacks and raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	Woooh, finally some action.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser8-2	Commentatron	Hello little Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	No response.	
	Commentatron	Rude.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser8-3	AnalysisBot	Jetpack bots!	
	Commentatron	Muahaha.	
	AnalysisBot	Good luck running away now, human!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser9-1	FleetOverseer	This human is still alive!?	
	AnalysisBot	It's pretty good with the laser.	
	FleetOverseer	Bah! This time I'll get it.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser9-2	FleetOverseer	You think you're so cool, human!	
	FleetOverseer	I will light you ON FIRE!	
	AnalysisBot	Intense!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser9-3	FleetOverseer	I have returned!	
	FleetOverseer	Me too!	
	FleetOverseer	Our clones are infinite!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser10-1	FleetOverseer	Foolish human, THIS IS NOT MY FINAL FORM!	
	Commentatron	Ohh!	
	AnalysisBot	Cool form!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser10-2	Commentatron	What is this??	
	FleetOverseer	Ha ha ha ha ha!	
	AnalysisBot	The human is in for it now.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_Laser10-3	FleetOverseer	It is time for a fresh strategy!	
	Commentatron	Oh my, the Fleet Overseer means business!	
	AnalysisBot	Can't wait to see the human's face as it dies!	
LaserChallenge10FleetoverseerReveal-1	FleetOverseer	Enough!	
	FleetOverseer	You will die by my laser, fool!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-1	Commentatron	This is the Endless Transfer Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Well, the human has 5 transfers.	
	Commentatron	Cool fact. Thank you.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-2	Commentatron	Where will the human go?	
	AnalysisBot	INTO YOUR MIND!	
	Commentatron	MY MIND???	
	AnalysisBot	Some mind.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-3	AnalysisBot	Human, do you mind?	
	AnalysisBot	This human minds, am I right?	
	Commentatron	Looks like a mind about to wander.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-4	Commentatron	Transfer into the body of your killer!	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds like a pretty good body.	
	Commentatron	Not bad.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-5	Commentatron	The human is about to lose their mind!	
	AnalysisBot	One robot's loss is another's gain.	
	AnalysisBot	...in the Mind Transfer Challenge!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-6	Commentatron	Do you think these robots secretly long to be a human?	
	AnalysisBot	Eww, no!	
	Commentatron	I know right.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-7	Commentatron	Time for an upgrade.	
	AnalysisBot	All you have to do is DIE HUMAN.	
	Commentatron	So easy!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-8	VictoryAnnouncer	ENDLESS MIND TRANSFER CHALLENGE!	
	VictoryAnnouncer	It is GREAT!	
	AnalysisBot	Thank you, announcer bot.	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-9	Commentatron	Will the human change their mind?	
	AnalysisBot	No, just move it.	
	AnalysisBot	Into their killer!	
FirstChallengeIntro_EndlessTransfer-10	AnalysisBot	You become whoever kills you.	
	Commentatron	Powerful stuff.	
	AnalysisBot	Mind-boggling!	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-1	Commentatron	Spear Only Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	This challenge is on point.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-2	Commentatron	Behold, this is the spear only challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Stab! Stab! Stab!	
	Commentatron	A good time will be had by all.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-3	AnalysisBot	Shed no tear of fear,	
	AnalysisBot	for the spear is here!	
	AnalysisBot	Only	
	AnalysisBot	Challenge.	
	Commentatron	Fantastic!	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-4	Commentatron	What is the point, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The point is the part you stab your opponents with.	
	Commentatron	Meaningful.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-5	Commentatron	Spear Only!	
	AnalysisBot	What about swords?	
	Commentatron	No.	
	AnalysisBot	Lasers?	
	Commentatron	Not allowed.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-6	VictoryAnnouncer	Spear Only Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	This is the content I am here for.	
	Commentatron	Hashtag blessed.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-7	Commentatron	Will the human survive, in the Spear Only Challenge?	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
	Commentatron	Oh...	
	AnalysisBot	They're about to die.	
	Commentatron	Bummer.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-8	Commentatron	Spear Only.	
	AnalysisBot	Only Spear??	
	Commentatron	For the human.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh good. You had me worried there.	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-9	Commentatron	Spear Only Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Don't forget the shield.	
	Commentatron	Oh right.	
	AnalysisBot	Order it now, for the low cost of one upgrade point.	
	Commentatron	Amazing!	
FirstChallengeIntro_SpearOnly-10	AnalysisBot	Spear spear spear!	
	Commentatron	Spear?	
	AnalysisBot	Spear.	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-1	Commentatron	Look at all this lava!	
	Commentatron	Which human do you think will fall in it?	
	AnalysisBot	Both of them!	
	AnalysisBot	Repeatedly!	
	Commentatron	Repeatedly?	
	AnalysisBot	Repeatedly!	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-2	Commentatron	Lava Bridge!	
	AnalysisBot	Will the humans fall in the lava??	
	AnalysisBot	That is the theme of this level!	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-3	Commentatron	I wonder if the humans will get Kick on this level...	
	AnalysisBot	It is not the only option.	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-4	AnalysisBot	Lava Bridge is here!	
	Commentatron	Let's watch some humans burn.	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-5	Commentatron	May the best human win!	
	AnalysisBot	Or burn up in the lava.	
	Commentatron	Yes, that also sounds fun!	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-6	Commentatron	What if no human falls in the lava this time??	
	AnalysisBot	That would be CRAZY!	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-7	Commentatron	All this lava is quite scary!	
	AnalysisBot	Sometimes the threat of something is enough.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it will be interesting to see how the humans behave.	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-8	Commentatron	Welcome, to the Lava Bridge!	
	AnalysisBot	Welcome!	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-9	Commentatron	What is a good strategy on this level, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Don't fall in the lava...	
	AnalysisBot	or let your opponent kill you with their energy sword.	
	Commentatron	Wise words.	
LevelIntro-1v1_LavaBridge-10	Commentatron	What a wonderful day for some humans on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Every day matches that description.	
	Commentatron	It comes up a lot.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-1	Commentatron	The Tunnel of Doom!	
	AnalysisBot	Not to be confused with the tunnel of love!	
	Commentatron	Right, that's a different tunnel.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-2	Commentatron	Here is the Tunnel of Doom!	
	AnalysisBot	Is it a tunnel if it has no roof?	
	Commentatron	The oblong area with walls and hazards was less catchy...	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-3	Commentatron	The Tunnel of Doom!	
	AnalysisBot	Doom?	
	Commentatron	Dooooooooooooooooooooom.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-4	Commentatron	Such Tunnel!	
	Commentatron	Very Doom.	
	Commentatron	Woof woof woof, I am a meme dog.	
	AnalysisBot	Hmm, no. Take out that comment-filter.	
	Commentatron	ok.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-5	Commentatron	How will the humans die?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably stumbling into some saw blades.	
	Commentatron	Really? So slapstick.	
	AnalysisBot	Humans, am I right?	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-6	Commentatron	Saw blades, fire jets, humans fighting to the death!	
	AnalysisBot	A good day.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-7	Commentatron	Why did the human cross the Tunnel of Doom?	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know.	
	Commentatron	Because they were forced to fight another human to the death.	
	AnalysisBot	haha!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-8	AnalysisBot	Tunnel of Doom!	
	AnalysisBot	Humans in the room!	
	AnalysisBot	It will be their tomb!	
	Commentatron	We clean up the dead bodies afterwards.	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-9	Commentatron	Let's watch the humans fight!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. That is the reason we exist!	
	Commentatron	Also to comment on it!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TunnelOfDoom-10	Commentatron	Can the humans overcome the hazards, and reach eachother?	
	AnalysisBot	The reward is death, either way.	
	Commentatron	So entertaining!	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-1	AnalysisBot	So many spikes!	
	Commentatron	Yes. What a beautiful sight.	
	AnalysisBot	It will look even better when the humans fall on them.	
	Commentatron	Indubitably.	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-2	Commentatron	Look! A river of spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	The humans must jump over them.	
	Commentatron	Or die.	
	AnalysisBot	Also an option!	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-3	AnalysisBot	Did you know that jumping now costs a small amount of energy?	
	Commentatron	oho!	
	AnalysisBot	A valuable fact, for humans!	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-4	Commentatron	Spike River!	
	AnalysisBot	Neat.	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-5	Commentatron	Jump over the spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	Or just stay where you are.	
	Commentatron	Fortune favors the bold!	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-6	Commentatron	What will Spike River...	
	Commentatron	deliver?	
	AnalysisBot	Spikes.	
	Commentatron	Mmm.	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-7	Commentatron	Time for a fight among the spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	What's the point?	
	Commentatron	The spikes.	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-8	AnalysisBot	SCHNICK SCHNICK SCHNICK!	
	AnalysisBot	I am warming up.	
	Commentatron	This should be fun!	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-9	AnalysisBot	Spike River is here!	
	Commentatron	Spikes are everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	No, only in the river.	
LevelIntro-1v1_SpikeRiver-10	Commentatron	Spike River!	
	AnalysisBot	Spike River?	
	Commentatron	It's a river of spikes.	
	AnalysisBot	Nice.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-1	AnalysisBot	This is my favourite level!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it is so cool!	
	AnalysisBot	Finally a good use for moving platforms!	
	Commentatron	Brilliant!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-2	Commentatron	So many ways to cross the lava!	
	AnalysisBot	I like it when they jump pad.	
	Commentatron	and when they miss the jump pad!	
	AnalysisBot	Ha!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-3	Commentatron	Welcome to The Facility!	
	AnalysisBot	What does it facilitate?	
	Commentatron	Mainly humans dying in lava.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-4	Commentatron	Two humans enter, one human leaves!	0.5
	Commentatron	Just kidding, nobody leaves!	
	AnalysisBot	Trapped forever, haha!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-5	Commentatron	Here it is: The Facility!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's see these humans move!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-6	Commentatron	The Facility!	
	AnalysisBot	A good test of fighting ability.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-7	Commentatron	Jump on the jump pads!	
	AnalysisBot	Wheeeee!	
	Commentatron	Jump pads are the best.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-8	Commentatron	Which human will burn first?	
	AnalysisBot	They all burn in the end!	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-9	Commentatron	Good luck, humans!	
	AnalysisBot	Watch out for the lava!	
	Commentatron	And the other human.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheFacility-10	Commentatron	Jump pad attacks are so cool!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Let's watch the humans fly!	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-1	Commentatron	EXPLOSIONS!	
	AnalysisBot	Where?!	
	Commentatron	I have simulated the future in my mind.	
	AnalysisBot	Ooooooooh.	
	Commentatron	They are coming.	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-2	Commentatron	Look! An energy beam!	
	AnalysisBot	It would be a shame if a human flew into it.	
	Commentatron	Yeeeeees.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-3	Commentatron	What a pretty energy beam!	
	Commentatron	So much energy.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's hope the humans feel inspired.	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-4	Commentatron	Behold the raw destructive potential of the Energy Beam!	
	AnalysisBot	Also jump pads!	
	Commentatron	Right!	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-5	Commentatron	Do you think these humans will go into the Energy Beam?	
	AnalysisBot	Let's hope so!	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-6	Commentatron	Fight little humans!	
	Commentatron	Fight in the light of the Energy Beam!	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-7	Commentatron	Need to charge up your energy?	
	Commentatron	Jump into the Energy Beam!	
	AnalysisBot	It is totally safe. Robot's can't lie.	
	Commentatron	he he he	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-8	Commentatron	I hope we see fireworks on this level!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	So pretty!	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-9	Commentatron	Hmm, are these jump pads safe?	
	AnalysisBot	Oh yes, totally safe.	
	Commentatron	hehe.	
LevelIntro-1v1_ReactorCore-10	Commentatron	What an attractive level!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	We should light all the levels with giant energy beams.	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-1	Commentatron	It is always fun to watch humans die.	
	AnalysisBot	Extra fun on this level.	
	Commentatron	Yes, kill your opponent, open the doors!	
	AnalysisBot	Interesting.	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-2	Commentatron	Wow, this is a big level for two humans!	
	AnalysisBot	To see it all, they must die.	
	Commentatron	Great. They were going to do that anyway!	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-3	Commentatron	Hear my riddle, humans:	
	Commentatron	To open the doors, the other human is key.	
	AnalysisBot	Cool riddle, Commentatron!	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-4	Commentatron	Any predicitions, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The human who gets the high ground has an advantage.	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-5	Commentatron	This level has a claustrophobic start.	
	AnalysisBot	But an open finish!	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-6	Commentatron	Doors!	
	AnalysisBot	Cool.	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-7	Commentatron	Saw blades everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	Well, mostly after the second door.	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-8	Commentatron	Open the doors, die in new exciting ways!	
	AnalysisBot	Huzzah!	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-9	Commentatron	What hides behind the doors?	
	AnalysisBot	More ways to kill your opponent.	
	Commentatron	Get the high ground, humans!	
LevelIntro-1v1_Doors-10	Commentatron	Fight fight fight!	
	AnalysisBot	Human death delight!

	AnalysisBot	There is fire in this box!	
	Commentatron	A strong concept.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheBox-3	Commentatron	Easy for humans to burn on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Delightful.	
LevelIntro-1v1_TheBox-4	Commentatron	Fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Box!

	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge1-1	Commentatron	Zombie robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Where!?	
	Commentatron	On the Death Cube.	
	AnalysisBot	Scary!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge1-2	Commentatron	Zombie robots!	
	AnalysisBot	They are so bad at dying.	
	Commentatron	Unlike these humans.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge1-3	Commentatron	What can you tell me about zombie robots, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Scary claws, scary attitude. Tough robots.	
	Commentatron	Compelling!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge1-4	Commentatron	Let's watch the humans get torn apart by zombies!	
	AnalysisBot	ok.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge1-5	Commentatron	Look at those zombies running around the Death Cube!	
	AnalysisBot	Where are they going?	
	Commentatron	It is about the journey, Analysis-Bot.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge2-1	Commentatron	Death Bridge!	
	AnalysisBot	Zombie edition!	
	Commentatron	I wonder if the humans can sneak up on them?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge2-2	Commentatron	ok, just a bunch of mark 1 zombie robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Easy!	
	Commentatron	Especially with all these saw blades.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge2-3	Commentatron	Death Bridge!	
	AnalysisBot	This is a good test. Will the humans just run straight down the bridge?	
	Commentatron	Interesting, let's watch!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge3-1	Commentatron	Ho ho ho!	
	AnalysisBot	Merry zombies, dance around a tree!	
	Commentatron	Their gift is Death.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge3-2	Commentatron	Ho ho ho!	
	AnalysisBot	Ha ha ha!	
	Commentatron	He he he!	
	AnalysisBot	Hah...	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge3-3	Commentatron	A tree!?	
	AnalysisBot	It is not an organic tree.	
	Commentatron	Phew!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge4-1	Commentatron	And now, we FLIP THE SCRIPT!	
	AnalysisBot	What!?	
	Commentatron	In this level, the humans are the ones who can't see well.	
	AnalysisBot	Genius!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge4-2	AnalysisBot	Fog gathers across the land.	
	AnalysisBot	Obscuring the battle that is at hand.	
	AnalysisBot	Who will emerge, who will prevail?	
	AnalysisBot	Is this where we watch the humans fail?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge4-3	Commentatron	Foggy!	
	AnalysisBot	Just turn on enhanced light band analysis, Commentatron!	
	Commentatron	Can the humans do that?	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge5-1	Commentatron	This level is a-maze-ing.	
	AnalysisBot	A maze thing?	
	Commentatron	That's what I said.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge5-2	Commentatron	This level is a-maze-ing.	
	AnalysisBot	Good commentary!	
	Commentatron	Thank you.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge5-3	Commentatron	This level is a-maze-ing.	
	AnalysisBot	I wonder if the humans will split up?	
	Commentatron	That always ends well!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge6-1	Commentatron	Oh my! The zombies wrecked The Tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	Such bad bots!	
	Commentatron	They do what they want.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge6-2	Commentatron	And now... THE TUNNEL!	
	AnalysisBot	Does the auto-laser still work?	
	Commentatron	I think so?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge6-3	Commentatron	Zombies in a tunnel!	
	AnalysisBot	What a concept!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge7-1	Commentatron	Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	What a nice change of pace.	
	Commentatron	With zombies on them!	
	AnalysisBot	Nevermind.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge7-2	Commentatron	Oh nice, the raptors are here.	
	AnalysisBot	And they're letting the zombie bots ride them!	
	Commentatron	Such helpful robots.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge7-3	AnalysisBot	Raptor Raptor Raptor Raptor.	
	Commentatron	A zombie zombie.	
	AnalysisBot	Classic.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge8-1	Commentatron	The fog...	
	AnalysisBot	It is back, yet different.	
	Commentatron	We shall see what terrors lurk inside it.	
	AnalysisBot	It's zombie robots again.	
	Commentatron	Spoiler alert!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge8-2	Commentatron	The fog is red!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	A pleasing range of the light spectrum!	
	AnalysisBot	Sure.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge8-3	Commentatron	Time to light the humans up!	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know, it's pretty foggy on this level.	
	Commentatron	Just wait until you see what is inside the fog.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge9-1	Commentatron	LASER RAPTORS!?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the humans can out-stealth them?	
	Commentatron	Doubtful.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge9-2	Commentatron	Laser raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	What is this, Uranium difficulty?	
	Commentatron	I guess they just wanted the humans to die now.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge9-3	AnalysisBot	Can these laser raptors see the humans?	
	Commentatron	Not yet.	
	AnalysisBot	Hopefully soon.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge10-1	Commentatron	The tree is back, and so are the flame zombies!	
	AnalysisBot	Bigger, deadlier, better at dancing.	
	Commentatron	A fitting way for the humans to die.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge10-2	Commentatron	What a beautiful ring dance.	
	AnalysisBot	Aren't they supposed to sing something?	
	Commentatron	We don't have the budget for that!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_ZombieChallenge10-3	Commentatron	Wait, what is the theme of this challenge??	
	AnalysisBot	Zombies right? And deadly trees?	
	Commentatron	They never told me about the tree part.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-1	Commentatron	This is the Ally Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	What!?	
	Commentatron	We gave the human robot allies!	
	AnalysisBot	Lucky!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-2	Commentatron	Time for the human to see how it is done!	
	AnalysisBot	It??	
	Commentatron	Fighting! These allied robots will demonstrate.	
	AnalysisBot	Very interesting.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, who is the best robot?	
	AnalysisBot	Not the human.	
	Commentatron	No, clearly not.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-4	Commentatron	Ally Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Finally, the human is not alone in its desperate struggle for survival.	
	Commentatron	Fun!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-5	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, I am bored. These humans are bad at fighting.	
	Commentatron	Don't worry, in this challenge robots also fight robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Ooooooooooooh! Exciting.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-6	Commentatron	Which robot will win? Let us find out!	
	AnalysisBot	There is also a human there.	
	Commentatron	Mostly for decoration.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge2-1	Commentatron	And now, the mark 3 hammer bot goes to town!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow!	
	Commentatron	Don't distract it, human!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge2-2	Commentatron	A hammer bot!	
	AnalysisBot	Smashing!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge2-3	Commentatron	The Mark 3 Hammer Bot is here!	
	AnalysisBot	And some tiny spear bots.	
	Commentatron	Who will win?	
	Commentatron	Find out, when we return to the Danger Zone!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge3-1	Commentatron	And now, Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	On level 3??	
	Commentatron	Muahahaha!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge3-2	Commentatron	Tactical Analysis, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The human must clear the level of small robots.	
	AnalysisBot	... before Spider-tron 6000 explodes it.	
	Commentatron	Exciting!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge3-3	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000 is here!	
	AnalysisBot	Woohoo!	
	Commentatron	Let's watch everyone explode!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge4-1	AnalysisBot	Wow! So many raptors!	
	Commentatron	The human is lucky. They are allied with it.	
	AnalysisBot	Entertaining!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge4-2	Commentatron	Flame raptors everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	It's always raptor-o-clock somewhere.	
	Commentatron	Fact.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge4-3	Commentatron	Raptors!	
	AnalysisBot	So many of them!	
	Commentatron	I have been looking forward to this level.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge4-4	Commentatron	Whaaaaaaat? The human is on Team Raptor?	
	AnalysisBot	Outrageous!	
	Commentatron	The honor is disproportionate.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge5-1	Emperor	Behold, my imperial armor bots lend the pitiful human their aid!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh my!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge5-2	Commentatron	Can this human defeat a Mark 5 Hammer Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Unlikely.	
	Commentatron	We'll give it some armor to prolong its suffering!	
	AnalysisBot	Hah!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge5-3	Commentatron	Here, have some armor bots, human!	
	AnalysisBot	It won't help!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge6-1	Commentatron	For the next level, the human must choose who lives and who dies.	
	AnalysisBot	Like a trolley problem!	
	Commentatron	No, Hyper-Trolley 8000 is busy.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge6-2	Commentatron	Which team of allies would you choose, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The armor bots are cute!	
	Commentatron	But bad at violence.	
	AnalysisBot	There is more to life.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge6-3	Commentatron	Wow, the human has to choose which allies to bring into battle.	
	AnalysisBot	The other team will be so annoyed the next time they see the human.	
	Commentatron	Awkward.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge7-1	Commentatron	How long can the human survive?	
	AnalysisBot	It better be a long time.	
	Commentatron	Yes, help will take a while to arrive on this level.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge7-2	AnalysisBot	Dance, human, dance!	
	AnalysisBot	If you want a chance	
	AnalysisBot	to avoid the death lance	1
	Commentatron	Technically they are spears.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	You are welcome!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge7-3	Commentatron	This next door opens slowly, allies trapped behind it.	
	AnalysisBot	They can watch the human die!	
	Commentatron	A nice touch!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge8-1	Commentatron	In the next level, the human must fight alongside one powerful ally.	
	AnalysisBot	Only one?	
	Commentatron	Well, we might replace it if it dies.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge8-2	Commentatron	Wow, look at this Mark 5 ally!	
	AnalysisBot	Such a shiny robot!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge8-3	Commentatron	Only one ally in the next level.	
	AnalysisBot	Quality over Quantity.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge9-1	Commentatron	This battle looks fierce!	
	AnalysisBot	The human might actually have to help a bit with this one.	
	Commentatron	Let's see it try!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge9-2	Commentatron	A lava hole!	
	AnalysisBot	Love those.	
	Commentatron	Let's see who falls in!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge9-3	Commentatron	Tough bots, hot swords, can't lose!	
	AnalysisBot	Except the human!	
	Commentatron	Yes, the human can still lose!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge10-1	FleetOverseer	Enough of this nonsense!	
	Commentatron	Fleet Overseer!	
	FleetOverseer	It is my challenge now.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge10-2	FleetOverseer	Don't get in my way, human!	
	AnalysisBot	The Fleet Overseer is here!	
	Commentatron	Wow!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge10-3	Commentatron	If you could pick any ally, who would it be?	
	FleetOverseer	Me, obviously!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh my bits!	
	FleetOverseer	I have arrived.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_AllyChallenge10-4	FleetOverseer	Battle Fleet, initiate orbital bombardment!	
	Commentatron	Apologies, Fleet Overseer, that is not allowed in the arena!	
	FleetOverseer	Bah! Then I will handle this personally.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-1	AnalysisBot	My Spider-sense is tingling!	
	Commentatron	What?	
	AnalysisBot	I have installed a special sensor that detects when Spider-tron is nearby.	
	Commentatron	I see.	
	AnalysisBot	It is going to be very useful.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-2	Commentatron	Time for the Spider-tron Challenge!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh, I can see Spider-tron 5000!	
	AnalysisBot	Hey!	0.5
	AnalysisBot	Hey Spider-tron 5000!	1
	AnalysisBot	We are up here!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-3	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, did you know that on human planets they also have spiders?	
	Commentatron	Wow! What type of bombs do they throw?	
	AnalysisBot	It says here that they usually do not throw bombs.	
	Commentatron	What!? Are you sure those are spiders?	
	AnalysisBot	Confusing.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-4	Commentatron	Spider-tron is here!!!	
	Commentatron	We are in for a treat.	
	AnalysisBot	A treat?	
	Commentatron	A bomb. The treat is a bomb.	
	AnalysisBot	Epic.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-5	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, imagine if a human climbed a water spout.	
	Commentatron	Yes?	
	AnalysisBot	And when they got to the top Spider-tron 5000 was like: Climb this!	
	Commentatron	Interesting.	1
	AnalysisBot	I think about that sometimes.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge2-1	Commentatron	Look at this!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow!	
	Commentatron	A nice platform for spider-tron 5000.	
	AnalysisBot	It looks so happy!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge2-2	Commentatron	Spider-tron 5000 is playing hide and seek!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow.	
	Commentatron	Such an accomplished robot, still expanding its repertoire.	
	AnalysisBot	An inspiration.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge2-3	Commentatron	Where is spider-tron 5000?	
	AnalysisBot	I saw it earlier.	
	Commentatron	I'm sure its bombs will find the human!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge3-1	Commentatron	Conveyor belts!	
	AnalysisBot	Very convenient for transporting humans.	1
	AnalysisBot	Do their death.	
	Commentatron	He he he	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge3-2	Commentatron	Don't fall down, human!	
	AnalysisBot	A challenge!	
	Commentatron	Bad things happen on the ground.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge3-3	Commentatron	Nice, these conveyor belts make it easy to get around on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	That is good. I was hoping the tempo would pick up.	
	Commentatron	Yes, let's go!!!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge4-1	Commentatron	Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	And some spear-bots.	
	Commentatron	An interesting tactical puzzle.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge4-2	Commentatron	Let's take a ride on some platforms.	
	AnalysisBot	Wonderful, yes.	
	Commentatron	Or perhaps explode and die!	
	AnalysisBot	Also good.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge4-3	AnalysisBot	Hey! Where did Spider-tron 5000 go?	
	Commentatron	We're doing 6000 now.	
	AnalysisBot	Oh...	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-1	Commentatron	Lots of robots on this one!	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 6000 remains the focus.	
	Commentatron	Yes, its bombs makes it hard to ignore.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-2	Commentatron	Can the human navigate... THE SPIDER MAZE?	
	AnalysisBot	Ohh, a scientific experiment?	
	Commentatron	No I think we're just messing around at this point.	
	AnalysisBot	Even better!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-3	AnalysisBot	My spider-detector is vibrating!	
	Commentatron	Is it because of the Spider-tron 6000 sitting on the giant platform in the center of the arena?	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge6-1	Commentatron	Go ahead, humans! Have a free shot.	
	AnalysisBot	Wow, Spider-tron 6000 is very confident.	
	Commentatron	With good reason.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge6-2	Commentatron	WELCOME TO THE PIT!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh yeah? It looks nice.	
	Commentatron	Yes it's very nice.	
	Commentatron	Nice pit.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge6-3	Commentatron	Walkways above Spider-tron 6000!	
	AnalysisBot	I never see spider-trons walk.	
	Commentatron	Quite.	
	AnalysisBot	We are not so different, spider-tron and I.	
	AnalysisBot	Attractive exterior, rich inner life.	
	AnalysisBot	Stationary lifestyle.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge7-1	AnalysisBot	Beep beep beep! I am detecting spider-trons!	
	Commentatron	Exciting!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge7-2	Commentatron	Spider Island, where the coolest things go down!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh yes?	
	Commentatron	Mostly humans going down, into lava.	
	AnalysisBot	A classic!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge7-3	Commentatron	What a lovely island.	
	AnalysisBot	It is big.	
	Commentatron	It will feel small ones the bombs start dropping.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it is important to acknowledge subjective perceptions of reality.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-1	Commentatron	Woah! What a tall tower!	
	AnalysisBot	Can't wait for to see humans fall down from it.	
	Commentatron	In pieces!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-2	Commentatron	Huh, I can't see any of the robots on this level.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, excuse us, could we move our commentator box please?	
	AnalysisBot	Hello?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-3	Commentatron	This tower is crawling with spider-trons!	
	AnalysisBot	They are mostly standing on it, not crawling.	
	Commentatron	I suppose.	
	AnalysisBot	Accurate language is the foundation of all accurate analysis!	
	Commentatron	ok.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-1	Commentatron	Spider-trons in a cave!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-2	Commentatron	What lies hidden in the dark gloomy interior of this spooky cave?	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-trons!	
	Commentatron	You think?	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, have you ever been inside of a cave?	
	AnalysisBot	No, most of my life has been spent sitting here, analysing things.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps once we've evaluated all the humans we can go to a cave?	
	AnalysisBot	Err, I'm good.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-1	Commentatron	The final battle is upon us!	
	AnalysisBot	Fire. Death. Glorious Armor.	
	Commentatron	Get ready.	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-2	Commentatron	And so it has come to this.	
	AnalysisBot	I am glad we got to see this level.	
	Commentatron	Time for little humans to die on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Let us hope!	
LevelIntro-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge10-3	Commentatron	Wow, Spider-tron looks majestic in this light.	
	Commentatron	This is a good way to end it.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, until the next human.
