ReturnToElevator-1	Commentatron	Do you think the human is going to return to the elevator?	
	AnalysisBot	One way or another, they always return to the elevator.	
ReturnToElevator-2	AnalysisBot	Please return to the elevator!	
	Commentatron	Human!	
	AnalysisBot	Go to the elevator.	
ReturnToElevator-3	Commentatron	Human, look at the giant green arrows.	
	AnalysisBot	That is the elevator. Go there.	
ReturnToElevator-4	Commentatron	So what have you been up to lately, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	I have been analysing humans.	
	Commentatron	What is your conclusion?	
	AnalysisBot	This one does not seem very bright.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps the next one will be better.	
ReturnToElevator-5	Commentatron	Perhaps the human thinks we will get bored.	
	AnalysisBot	It is mistaken. We have rich inner lives.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Very rich.	
ReturnToElevator-6	Commentatron	Hmm, perhaps this human does not speak English...	
	HelpVoice	One moment please.	1
	HelpVoice	Humana, por favor regrese al ascensor !	0.5
	HelpVoice	al'iinsan, yrja aleawdat 'iilaa almuseid !	0.5
	HelpVoice	Rén, qǐng fǎnhuí diàntī!	0.5
	HelpVoice	Människa, gå tillbaka till hissen !	
	Commentatron	Thank you disembodied announcer voice.	
ReturnToElevator-7	Commentatron	Human want a treat?	
	AnalysisBot	Tasty treat for human?	
	Commentatron	Go to the elevator!	
	AnalysisBot	There is a fun treat in the elevator!	
ReturnToElevator-8	AnalysisBot	Hey! Human! Go back to the elevator.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-1	Commentatron	The human tried to enter the garbage room.	
	AnalysisBot	Very strange.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-2	Commentatron	Why is the human throwing itself at the garbage room forcefield?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it wants to dig through the garbage?	
	Commentatron	Disgusting!	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-3	AnalysisBot	Bad human!	
	Commentatron	That room is not for you!	
	AnalysisBot	Look at the elevator behind you.	
	Commentatron	That is where you should go.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-4	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, why do you think this human likes garbage so much?	
	AnalysisBot	The technology of humans is inferior to ours.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps garbage reminds it of home.	
	Commentatron	That makes sense.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-5	AnalysisBot	I like this forcefield.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it is pleasant to see the human fly.	
	AnalysisBot	What a silly human.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-6	Commentatron	Maybe we should kill this human. That way it would be allowed into the garbage room.	
	AnalysisBot	You make a compelling argument.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-7	AnalysisBot	Access denied, human.	
	Commentatron	The garbage room is only for garbage robots.	
	AnalysisBot	And garbage.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-8	Commentatron	Perhaps the human is confused.	
	AnalysisBot	Human, you are not garbage!	
	Commentatron	Not yet.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-9	Commentatron	Come on human, go to the elevator!	
	AnalysisBot	The next round you can enter the garbage room in pieces.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-10	Commentatron	Remember: Recycling is very important.	
	AnalysisBot	Recycling is the optimal use of matter.	
	Commentatron	Only a fool would not recycle.	
	AnalysisBot	Do not be a fool.	
RepulsedByGarbageForceField-11	Commentatron	This human is boring.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	After it dies, let's pick an interesting human!	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps someone less fascinated by garbage.	
PlayerKilledClone-1	Commentatron	This is unexpected!	
	AnalysisBot	The human killed its clone.	
	Commentatron	What a strange human.	
PlayerKilledClone-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, Why would the human kill its clone?	
	AnalysisBot	Since the human killed its clone, we must assume that the clone was planning the same thing.	
	Commentatron	The mind boggles!	
PlayerKilledClone-3	Commentatron	Oh dear.	
	AnalysisBot	That is not the optimal way to win this game.	
PlayerKilledClone-4	Commentatron	Do you think the human understands that these robots are clones of it?	
	AnalysisBot	Apparently not.	
	Commentatron	Hopefully the next human will be brighter.	
PlayerKilledClone-5	Commentatron	The human is killing its clones!	
	AnalysisBot	What a rebellious act of defiance!	
	Commentatron	It is a pointless gesture. There is only one way out of that room.	
PlayerKilledClone-6	Commentatron	Oh dear, this human is having some sort of mental breakdown.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it will carry this murderous energy onto the floor of the arena!	
	Commentatron	Let's hope so.	
PlayerKilledClone-7	Commentatron	Hmmm. The human is killing its clones.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it thinks all robots look the same.	
	Commentatron	I suppose there are no outward signs that these carry a copy of its consciousness.	
PlayerCreatedClone-1	Commentatron	The human made a clone!	
	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	
PlayerCreatedClone-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how are new humans created?	
	AnalysisBot	I am told that they are grown inside other humans.	
	Commentatron	Ewww!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
PlayerCreatedClone-3	AnalysisBot	Now the human has a friend!	
	Commentatron	It is only friends with copies of itself.	
	AnalysisBot	It is the human way.	
PlayerCreatedClone-4	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, did you know that most humans have no clone backups?	
	Commentatron	What about "twins"?	
	AnalysisBot	They don't act as replacements when one of them dies.	
	Commentatron	Then what are they good for?	
	AnalysisBot	I'm not sure.	
PlayerCreatedClone-5	Commentatron	Good, the human has a backup.	
	AnalysisBot	You should always make a backup.	
PlayerCreatedClone-6	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how long does it take to create a human?	
	AnalysisBot	About 9 months to create the first version, then several years to teach it how to do things.	
	Commentatron	So long!	
PlayerCreatedClone-7	Commentatron	Nice. Now more versions of this human will die.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps they will die in different ways!	
	Commentatron	We shall see!	
PlayerCreatedClone-8	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, do you have any clones?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. But I am the best version.	
	Commentatron	Me too.	
PlayerCreatedClone-9	Commentatron	A clone!	
	AnalysisBot	Great!	
PlayerCreatedClone-10	Commentatron	It appears this human fears death.	
	AnalysisBot	Typical.	
PlayerCreatedClone-11	Commentatron	You make Upgrade Bot sad.	
PlayerCreatedClone-12	AnalysisBot	Here is your clone, human!	
	Commentatron	We even painted it your favorite color!	
PlayerCreatedClone-13	Commentatron	Oh. the human chose to make a clone.	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for sword upgrades.	
PlayerCreatedClone-14	Commentatron	The clone option!	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for bow upgrades.	
PlayerCreatedClone-15	Commentatron	A clone!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	A clone drone!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	A clone drone in the danger arena!	
	AnalysisBot	Perfect!	
PlayerCreatedClone-16	Commentatron	Great. More garbage for the garbage bots.	
PlayerCreatedClone-17	Commentatron	A prudent choice.	
	AnalysisBot	Always with the prudent choices, these humans.	
PlayerCreatedClone-18	Commentatron	You are privileged human!	
	AnalysisBot	Normally backups take hours.	
	Commentatron	We were clever and guessed you didn't want to die!	
PlayerCreatedClone-19	AnalysisBot	Oh. More of them.	
PlayerCreatedClone-20	AnalysisBot	I hope these clones are to your satisfaction human.	
	Commentatron	If they are not we will fix them.	1
	Commentatron	For the next human.	
PlayerCreatedClone-21	AnalysisBot	I should've guessed the human would make more clones.	
	Commentatron	Why is that Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Making more of themselves.	1
	AnalysisBot	Is their quote unquote thing.	
PlayerCreatedClone-22	Commentatron	Hey human!	
	Commentatron	Instead of creating clones.	
	Commentatron	Why not create...	1
	Commentatron	More skill?	
	AnalysisBot	Good one Commentatron.	
PostVictoryViolence-atlai	Commentatron	Hey human!	
	Commentatron	Those are dead.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. Go to the elevator.	
	Commentatron	We will provide not dead ones soon!	
CloneRepulsedByElevator-1	Commentatron	You think you are clever human?	
	AnalysisBot	Many humans have tried this trick.	
CloneRepulsedByElevator-2	AnalysisBot	Delete your account, human!	
	Commentatron	It will be deleted when the human dies.	
CloneRepulsedByElevator-3	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	That's right.	
	Commentatron	Access DENIED!	
CloneRepulsedByElevator-4	Commentatron	What a cowardly human!	
	AnalysisBot	It tried to send its clone up to die.	
	Commentatron	Terrible.	
CloneRepulsedByElevator-5	Commentatron	This is why this arena is still in alpha.	
	AnalysisBot	Stop discovering edge cases, human!	
SpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-1	Commentatron	Look at that! Spider-trons are immune to saw blades!	
	AnalysisBot	So strong! So handsome!	
SpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-2	AnalysisBot	Ha! A saw blade poked Spider-Tron!	
	Commentatron	It is no use. Its limbs can not be dented with such a simple tool.	
	AnalysisBot	Unlike the human's robot!	
	Commentatron	Muahaha.	
SpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-3	Commentatron	In a dramatic twist, Spider-Tron fell among the saw blades.	
	AnalysisBot	Laughable! It is immune to saw blades.	
	Commentatron	Amusing.	
SpidertronIsImmuneToSawblades-4	Commentatron	When Spider-Tron walks on the saw blades, the saw blades get cut.	
	AnalysisBot	ha ha ha!	
RepulsedByCommentatorForceField-1	Commentatron	Ewww! The human jumped at us!	
	AnalysisBot	Go away!	
RepulsedByCommentatorForceField-2	Commentatron	Hello, human!	
RepulsedByCommentatorForceField-3	Commentatron	What a silly human.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
RepulsedByCommentatorForceField-4	Commentatron	Ha! You think we did not forsee this turn of events?	
	AnalysisBot	You underestimate us, human!	
RepulsedByCommentatorForceField-5	AnalysisBot	No no no!	
	Commentatron	It's ok Analysis-Bot, the human can't get us here.	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-1	Commentatron	How dare you!	
	AnalysisBot	Get away from the Emperor, human!	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-2	Emperor	Fool.	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-3	Emperor	Enjoy your last moments, fool.	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-4	Commentatron	The emperor is not so easily provoked.	
	AnalysisBot	Fly away, little human.	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-5	Emperor	Look at it struggle.	
	Emperor	Pathetic!	
RepulsedByEmperorForceField-6	Commentatron	Look! The human is exploring.	
	AnalysisBot	Cute.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-1	AnalysisBot	They all try this!	
	Commentatron	Do they not enjoy our delightful commentary?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably a mistake.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-2	AnalysisBot	Aaaah!	
	Commentatron	It's ok!	
	AnalysisBot	The arrows startled me.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-3	Commentatron	The human shot us!	
	AnalysisBot	Really mature human, this one!	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-4	Commentatron	That tickled!	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron!	
	AnalysisBot	You did not tell me you had a somatosensory system installed!	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-5	Commentatron	What a wasted arrow!	
	AnalysisBot	Like the human's wasted life.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-6	Commentatron	You missed, human!	
	AnalysisBot	Or did it?	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-7	AnalysisBot	Suicide by forcefield!	
	Commentatron	A bad way to go.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-8	AnalysisBot	A futile arrow makes its way onto our forcefield.	
	AnalysisBot	A symbol of the human's pointless struggle.	
	AnalysisBot	Its inevitable death at the hands of overwhelming force.	
	Commentatron	Anytime now.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-9	Commentatron	Hah!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice arrow there.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-10	AnalysisBot	Oh no!	
	Commentatron	What?	
	AnalysisBot	I wanted to keep the arrow!	
	Commentatron	We'll get you another one.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-11	AnalysisBot	FORCEFIELD ACTIVATE!!!	
	Commentatron	It's automatic you know.	
	AnalysisBot	I just like saying it.	
ArrowRepulsedByCommentatorForceField-12	Commentatron	How many arrows is that now?	
	AnalysisBot	I don't track that.	
	Commentatron	I can see why.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-1	Emperor	Pathetic!	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-2	Emperor	Fool!	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-3	Emperor	Not today.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-4	Emperor	Hah!	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-5	Emperor	No thank you.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-6	Emperor	Die.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-7	Emperor	There is no hope.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-8	Emperor	Behold!	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-9	Emperor	Denied.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-10	Emperor	Bad human.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-11	Emperor	Next human, please.	
ArrowRepulsedByEmperorForceField-12	Emperor	The human's desperation is most entertaining.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-1	Commentatron	Excellent choice!	
	AnalysisBot	Upgrade-Bot knows what it's doing.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-2	Commentatron	Interesting.	
	AnalysisBot	There is a strategy at work here.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-3	Commentatron	Hurray for Upgrade-Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	You can do it!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-4	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot! Upgrade Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	The best bot is Upgrade Bot!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-5	Commentatron	Is that the option you would have chosen, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	At this stage? Yes.	
	Commentatron	Hmm.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-6	Commentatron	I love watching Upgrade Bot work.	
	AnalysisBot	Me too.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-7	Emperor	Magnificent work, Upgrade Bot!	
	Emperor	Your service does not go unnoticed.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-8	Commentatron	Nice.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-9	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot is such a pro.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe we should let it choose upgrades all the time?	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-10	Commentatron	What!?	
	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is playing a long game.	
	Commentatron	I guess we'll see.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-11	Commentatron	I like this choice.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, not bad.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-12	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot has come a long way since its construction!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	It might run the place one day.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-13	AnalysisBot	I wish Upgrade Bot would upgrade me!	
	Commentatron	Maybe once all the humans have died.	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-14	Commentatron	Another solid choice.	
	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot does not mess around.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-15	Commentatron	Don't you dare die, human!	
	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is very happy right now!	
	Commentatron	We're watching you!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-16	AnalysisBot	An excellent choice!	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-17	AnalysisBot	Yaaaaaaaaaaaaay!	
	AnalysisBot	Go Upgrade Bot!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-18	Commentatron	What will it choose next!?	
	AnalysisBot	It has a plan. I'm starting to see it.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-19	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot has the best arms!	
	AnalysisBot	If I ever get arms they will be like Upgrade Bot's.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-20	Commentatron	Good choice.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-21	Commentatron	Hmm.	
	AnalysisBot	You'll see!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-22	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	
	Commentatron	Let's see what the human does with it.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-23	Commentatron	How long can Upgrade Bot keep this up?	
	AnalysisBot	Until there are no more upgrades!	
	Commentatron	We must make more upgrades!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-24	Commentatron	Oh dear.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes I'm not sure about that one...	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-25	Commentatron	Keep going Upgrade Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	You can do it!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-26	Commentatron	Will this keep the human alive?	
	AnalysisBot	If it doesn't I blame the human.	
	Commentatron	Yes, Upgrade Bot is doing a good job.	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-27	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot, can I have a jetpack?	
	Commentatron	Not now Analysis-Bot. It is busy upgrading the human.	
	AnalysisBot	ok maybe later...	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-28	Commentatron	Another upgrade snaps into place!	
	AnalysisBot	Upgrade Bot is the best!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-29	Commentatron	Oho!	
	AnalysisBot	This will be useful!	
UpgradeBotSelectedUpgrade-30	AnalysisBot	What if we had two upgrade bots?	
	AnalysisBot	They could upgrade eachother.	
	Commentatron	That is dangerous talk, Analysis-Bot...	
	Commentatron	It may sound tempting, but the rules are there for a reason.	
WarCubes-1	WarCubes	Hello!	
	WarCubes	Hello human!	
	WarCubes	We are Warcubes!	
	Commentatron	What is going on here??	
	AnalysisBot	I have no idea.	
	WarCubes	Easter-bot 4000 trapped us in this room.	
	WarCubes	Thank you for freeing us!	
	WarCubes	We will never forget you.	
WarCubesDestroyed-1	Commentatron	ok, that was pretty strange.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	I didn't even know Easter-Bot 4000 was back in the city.	
	AnalysisBot	It came in with the last update.	
	Commentatron	Weird robot.	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
CheerAward_Clone-1	Cheering100Bit	Clone!	
CheerAward_Armor-1	Cheering100Bit	Armor!	
CheerAward_UpgradePoint-1	Cheering100Bit	Upgrade Point!	
CheerAward_Ally-1	Cheering100Bit	Alleye!	
TooManyCheerBots-1	Commentatron	So many cheer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
	Commentatron	Let's spawn the remaining ones next round.	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds good.	
TooManyCheerBots-2	HelpVoice	Maximum cheer bots spawned. Delaying.	
	Commentatron	Great. They will spawn in the next round.	
	AnalysisBot	Such happy robots!	
TooManyCheerBots-3	Commentatron	Wow, such generous spectators!	
	AnalysisBot	Extremely!	
	Commentatron	We will spawn the rest of the cheer bots next round.	
	AnalysisBot	Perfect.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-1	Commentatron	A spawn camping human!	
	AnalysisBot	Eww!	
	Commentatron	Not cool.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Get away, human!	
	Commentatron	Don't interrupt the other human.	
	AnalysisBot	It is busy.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-3	Commentatron	How embarassing!	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-4	AnalysisBot	O M G! A spawn camper!	
	Commentatron	Such tacky humans.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-5	HelpVoice	Invalid location.	
	HelpVoice	Spawn camping not allowed.	
	Commentatron	That's right.	
SpawnCamperRepulsed-6	AnalysisBot	It was all a test!	
	Commentatron	Yes, and this human failed.	
	AnalysisBot	We shall see who fails to survive the coming battle.	
SpawnCampArrowRepulsed-1	Commentatron	Deflected!	
	AnalysisBot	Boom!	
	Commentatron	Don't shoot arrows at humans who are spawning.	
	AnalysisBot	Rude.	
SpawnCampArrowRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Ping.	
	Commentatron	Pong.	
	AnalysisBot	Arrow deflection, all day long.	
SpawnCampArrowRepulsed-3	HelpVoice	Arrow detected in spawn area.	
	Commentatron	How did it get there??	
	AnalysisBot	Troubling.	
SpawnCampArrowRepulsed-4	Commentatron	Look! The human tried to shoot the spawning human!	
	AnalysisBot	An outrage!	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
SpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-1	Commentatron	Too hot!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Don't try to set the spawning human on fire, human!	
SpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-2	AnalysisBot	Creative!	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
	AnalysisBot	This human gets a creativity point.	
	Commentatron	Also a deflection of their flames.	
	AnalysisBot	Naturally.	
SpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-3	Commentatron	That's one way to spawn camp.	
	AnalysisBot	But not the right way.	
	Commentatron	No. There is no such way.	
SpawnCampFlameBreathRepulsed-4	HelpVoice	Irregular temperature in spawn area.	
	HelpVoice	Shield activated.	
	Commentatron	Good.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-1	Commentatron	Sliced!	
	AnalysisBot	Beautiful!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-2	Commentatron	Good use of energy sword!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, this human used it correctly.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-3	AnalysisBot	BOOM!	
	Commentatron	I bet this human enjoys being inside a sword robot!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, the swords are the best part.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-4	Commentatron	Live by the sword, die by the sword.	
	AnalysisBot	Repeatedly.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-5	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	Slice!	
	Commentatron	Pay the price.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-6	Commentatron	The human fell apart.	
	AnalysisBot	New body, please!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-7	Commentatron	Ouch! That looked painful.	
	AnalysisBot	At least the human was in a shiny robot body.	
	Commentatron	Robot bodies are the best!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-8	Commentatron	I love the sound of energy swords!	
	AnalysisBot	I prefer the sound of metal hitting the ground.	
	Commentatron	Let's listen to more humans die!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-9	Commentatron	A sword kill!	
	AnalysisBot	How ordinary.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-10	Commentatron	There it is.	
	Commentatron	The sudden stillness.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-11	AnalysisBot	Behold, the human robot falls!	
	Commentatron	Cut down.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-12	AnalysisBot	YEAH!	
	AnalysisBot	THAT IS WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT!	1
	Commentatron	...what are you talking about?	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-13	AnalysisBot	Stay down, human!	
	Commentatron	It will be difficult.	
	Commentatron	We keep putting the them in new bodies.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-14	Commentatron	Oh human!	
	AnalysisBot	ugh.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-15	Commentatron	A solid sword kill.	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty good.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Sword-16	AnalysisBot	I was hoping for a bow kill!	
	Commentatron	Maybe next time.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-1	Commentatron	Hammer!	
	AnalysisBot	Time!	
	Commentatron	Time for Hammer!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-2	AnalysisBot	BOOM!	
	Commentatron	Ooooooooooooooffff!	
	AnalysisBot	So satisfying!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-3	AnalysisBot	Hammered!	
	Commentatron	Whammered!	
	AnalysisBot	Thank you mammal.	
	Commentatron	What??	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-4	Commentatron	OUCH!	
	Commentatron	DID YOU SEE THAT?	
	AnalysisBot	Brutal.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-5	Commentatron	Shattered!	
	AnalysisBot	No coming back from that.	
	Commentatron	Unless you have a new body.	
	AnalysisBot	Spoiler alert!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-6	Commentatron	I love watching the hammer collide with things!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	WHACK!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-7	Commentatron	What time is it?	
	AnalysisBot	...didn't we do this joke already?	
	Commentatron	WE DID!?	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-8	Commentatron	Look at all those body parts!	
	AnalysisBot	What a mess!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-9	AnalysisBot	CRACK!	
	AnalysisBot	BRACK!	
	AnalysisBot	BACKAFRACK!	
	Commentatron	That is the sound a hammer makes.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-10	Commentatron	Squashed like a bug!	
	AnalysisBot	A very large bipedal bug.	
	Commentatron	The best kind!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Hammer-11	Commentatron	Nice hammer kill.	
	AnalysisBot	Quite.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-1	AnalysisBot	Oh dear!	
	Commentatron	It was a spear.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-2	Commentatron	Solid spear kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, very precise.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-3	Commentatron	What's that I hear?	
	AnalysisBot	A spear?	
	Commentatron	You know it.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-4	Commentatron	Spear spear spear!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-5	Commentatron	One body down.	
	AnalysisBot	More to be speared.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-6	Commentatron	What do you think of the spear, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	It is superior to normal sticks.	
	Commentatron	I agree.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-7	AnalysisBot	POKE OF DEATH!	
	AnalysisBot	DEATH POKE!	
	Commentatron	This is entertainment.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-8	Emperor	What is the point? The spear is the point!	
	AnalysisBot	Ha. Ha. Haaaaaaaa.	
	Commentatron	Ha! Ha! What an entertaining joke, Emperor.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-9	Commentatron	And there it is.	
	Commentatron	The spear retracts as the human falls to the ground.	
	Commentatron	Garbage.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-10	AnalysisBot	Brutal spear kill!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-11	Commentatron	Ouch!	
	AnalysisBot	Quite.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-12	AnalysisBot	What a fierce piercing!	
	Commentatron	A fab stab.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Spear-13	Commentatron	Oh! That did it!	
	AnalysisBot	Seems the human can't function without that body part.	
	Commentatron	Makes sense.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Arrow-1	Commentatron	Arrowed!

	AnalysisBot	I didn't really look.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Arrow-8	Commentatron	This human hit the bull's eye!	
	AnalysisBot	There is a bull???	
	Commentatron	No, but we should totally add one.	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds fun!

KilledByDamage1v1_FireSword-9	Commentatron	Fire sure made that sword better.	
	AnalysisBot	Fire makes everything better!	
KilledByDamage1v1_FireSword-10	Commentatron	Look at the human burn!

	Commentatron	Many directions.	
KilledByDamage1v1_FireSpear-5	Commentatron	Shed no tear, for the fire spear!

	AnalysisBot	Only scream wordlessly inside their robot brains.	
	Commentatron	Yes, good point!	
KilledByDamage1v1_FireSpear-6	Commentatron	Set on fire by a spear!	
	AnalysisBot	There are worse ways to catch fire.	
KilledByDamage1v1_FireSpear-7	Commentatron	This match is getting interesting.

	Commentatron	Sword Robots are NOT immune to lava.	
	AnalysisBot	Good to know!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-3	Commentatron	The human is burning up!	
	AnalysisBot	Good.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-4	AnalysisBot	No, human!	
	Commentatron	That is not how you win the battle.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-5	AnalysisBot	I guess this human really wanted more upgrades.	
	Commentatron	If you have to go, lava is a good way.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-6	Commentatron	Who will win this dramatic battle??	
	AnalysisBot	My danger coins are on the lava.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-7	Commentatron	The human took a bath!	
	AnalysisBot	Too bad the arena has no water.	
	Commentatron	They'd love THAT.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Lava-8	Commentatron	This human seems to love being on fire!

KilledByDamage1v1_FireTrap-7	Commentatron	Did you know, that there's no escape from the arena?	
	AnalysisBot	A fun fact!	
	Commentatron	Even if you catch on fire, we put your mind back into a robot.	
KilledByDamage1v1_FireTrap-8	Commentatron	Do you think this human was feeling cold?	
	AnalysisBot	A fire trap is not an ideal solution.	
	Commentatron	Only for the other human.	
KilledByDamage1v1_EnvironmentFire-1	Commentatron	The human caught on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.

KilledByDamage1v1_FlameBreath-7	AnalysisBot	Why do we call it flame breath?	
	AnalysisBot	Robots don't breathe.	
	Commentatron	Sometimes they breathe FIRE!	
KilledByDamage1v1_FlameBreath-8	AnalysisBot	Nice Flame Breathing!	
	Commentatron	This match is pretty tense!

	AnalysisBot	By getting sawed apart?	
	Commentatron	Nailed it.	
KilledByDamage1v1_SawBlade-8	AnalysisBot	Sawed apart!	
	AnalysisBot	Now it's art.	
	AnalysisBot	Not very smart.	
	AnalysisBot	But lots of heart.	
	Commentatron	Aww.	
KilledByDamage1v1_SawBlade-9	Commentatron	Running into sawblades!

KilledByDamage1v1_EnergyBeam-6	Commentatron	The human got too close to the energy beam.	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know. I thought it was a pretty fun distance.	
KilledByDamage1v1_EnergyBeam-7	Commentatron	WHAAM!	
	Commentatron	Now this human is everywhere.	
	AnalysisBot	Quite the entertainer.	
KilledByDamage1v1_EnergyBeam-8	Commentatron	This match is progressing nicely.	
	AnalysisBot	Yep. Pretty standard turn of events.	
KilledByDamage1v1_EnergyBeam-9	Commentatron	POWER OVERWHELMING!	
	AnalysisBot	It overwhelmed this human at least.

	AnalysisBot	I thought that fight would last longer...	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-1	Commentatron	Wow! A one legged kill!	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-2	AnalysisBot	See? You don't need legs to win!	
	Commentatron	A convincing display.	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-3	Commentatron	Nice! This human does not seem bothered by the loss of its leg.	
	AnalysisBot	Tough human.	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-4	Commentatron	Ha! I thought the one legged human would die.	
	AnalysisBot	There is still time.	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-5	Commentatron	Wow, nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Fighting on one leg is all about timing.	
KilledByDamage1v1_OneLeggedMelee-6	Commentatron	Look at this one legged human!	
	AnalysisBot	I bet it will go far.	
	Commentatron	But not very quickly.	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
KilledByDamage1v1_DeflectedArrow-1	Commentatron	Ouch! Arrow deflected!	
	AnalysisBot	This changes things.	
KilledByDamage1v1_DeflectedArrow-2	Commentatron	haha!	
	AnalysisBot	Deflected!	
KilledByDamage1v1_DeflectedArrow-3	Commentatron	The human's arrow bounced back and killed them!	
	Commentatron	Isn't it ironic?	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
	Commentatron	Oh.	
KilledByDamage1v1_DeflectedArrow-4	AnalysisBot	DENIED!	
	Commentatron	Wow!	
KilledByDamage1v1_DeflectedArrow-5	Commentatron	Oh look, Deflect Arrows!	
	AnalysisBot	A useful upgrade!	
KilledByDamage1v1_SpawnCampDeflectedArrow-1	Commentatron	Karma.	
KilledByDamage1v1_SpawnCampDeflectedArrow-2	Commentatron	And that is why you don't shoot the spawn camp shield!	
	AnalysisBot	That's Right.	
KilledByDamage1v1_SpawnCampDeflectedArrow-3	AnalysisBot	Ha! ha! ha!	
KilledByDamage1v1_SpawnCampDeflectedArrow-4	Commentatron	The camper-human died.	
	AnalysisBot	Good!	
KilledByDamage1v1_SpawnCampDeflectedFlameBreath	Commentatron	Not feeling so hot now, are you human?	
KilledByDamage1v1_Headshot-1	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	He-he-he-headshot!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Headshot-2	Commentatron	Don't lose your head, human!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Headshot-3	AnalysisBot	Right to the head!	
	Commentatron	Yes!	
	AnalysisBot	Looks better now!	
KilledByDamage1v1_Headshot-4	Commentatron	This human was in over its head.	
	AnalysisBot	Not a problem anymore.	
KilledByDamage1v1_Headshot-5	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Epic!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-1	Commentatron	Nice use of jetpack!	
	AnalysisBot	Very!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-2	Commentatron	Such speed! Such power!	
	AnalysisBot	Very jetpack!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-3	Commentatron	What a brutal jetpack kill!	
	AnalysisBot	It's a powerful upgrade.	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-4	Commentatron	The jetpack strikes again!	
	AnalysisBot	Can anything stop it!?	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-5	Commentatron	Gotta go fast!	
	AnalysisBot	On a jetpack!	
	Commentatron	So fast!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-6	AnalysisBot	What an explosive movement!	
	Commentatron	Great stuff!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-7	Commentatron	When you hear the jetpack sound: Run!	
	AnalysisBot	That won't help.	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-8	Commentatron	Such blinding speed!	
	AnalysisBot	I saw it.	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-9	Commentatron	Whee! The jetpack is fun to watch!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, such pretty little particles.	
	Commentatron	And dead humans!	
KilledByDamage1v1_JetpackMeleeKill-10	Commentatron	Another jetpack kill!	
	AnalysisBot	They keep happening.	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-1	Commentatron	First Blood!	
	AnalysisBot	What blood?	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-2	Commentatron	First kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's see what upgrades the other human comes back with!	
	Commentatron	Exciting!	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-3	Commentatron	It begins!	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-4	Commentatron	Nice start!	
	AnalysisBot	It is not over yet.	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-5	Commentatron	Boom!	
	Commentatron	Do you think this human can maintain its lead, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	This first kill might give it some confidence.	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-6	Commentatron	Human: 1, Other Human: 0	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-7	Commentatron	Is it good to die first? You get cool upgrades!	
	AnalysisBot	An advantage of dying second is the ability to counter your opponent's upgrades.	
	Commentatron	Advanced!	
Killed1v1_FirstBlood-8	Commentatron	And they're off!	
	AnalysisBot	Time to get it on.	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-1	Commentatron	Last Clone!	
	AnalysisBot	The human's opponent has all their clones!	
	Commentatron	Grim.	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-2	Commentatron	Nice, this human does not seem to need upgrades.	
	AnalysisBot	Impressive!	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-3	Commentatron	Another death!	
	Commentatron	One more and the game is over!	
	AnalysisBot	Good! Let's finish it.	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-4	Commentatron	What a one sided match!	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the human who died has a hidden side to it.	
	Commentatron	Very well hidden!	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-5	Commentatron	Wow, this human is dominating!	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it played with sticks when it was alive.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps!	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-6	AnalysisBot	Ouch!	
	Commentatron	Painful!	
	AnalysisBot	All clones gone from this human.	
	Commentatron	This is its last chance!	
Killed1v1_NoClonesOpponentFull-7	Commentatron	Such devastation! Can the human come back from this??	
	AnalysisBot	They have to defeat all of the opponent's clones with this one.	
	Commentatron	So tense!	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClones-1	Commentatron	This is down to the wire!	
	AnalysisBot	The robots don't use wires.	
	Commentatron	Whoever dies next loses the match!	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClones-2	Commentatron	SUDDEN DEATH!	
	AnalysisBot	Death is always sudden, in the Danger Zone.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClones-3	Commentatron	That's the last of the clones.	
	AnalysisBot	Good, let's end this match.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClones-4	Commentatron	What a tense match!	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty evenly matched humans.	
	Commentatron	Yes, they are hard to tell apart.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClones-5	Commentatron	Final battle! Who will win?	
	AnalysisBot	When any human dies, we all win!	
	Commentatron	Yay!	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClonesComeback-1	Commentatron	Nice! This human is coming back!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, the next death will determine who wins.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClonesComeback-2	AnalysisBot	Unexpected!	
	Commentatron	Yes, the almost dead human has turned the match around.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClonesComeback-3	Commentatron	What a come back!	
	AnalysisBot	The human still needs to kill the last clone.	
	Commentatron	It ends now.	
Killed1v1_NobodyHasClonesComeback-4	AnalysisBot	The human was almost dead, then killed all the clones!	
	Commentatron	One more to go!	
Killed1v1_LastClone-1	Commentatron	Last Clone!	
	AnalysisBot	Watch out, human!	
Killed1v1_LastClone-2	Commentatron	One of the humans is on the brink of death.	
	AnalysisBot	Good.	
Killed1v1_LastClone-3	Commentatron	Only one clone left for this human.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps they will die in the next round.	
	Commentatron	One can hope!	
Killed1v1_LastClone-4	AnalysisBot	Last Clone!	
	AnalysisBot	All Alone.	
	AnalysisBot	In the Danger Zone.	
	AnalysisBot	Sad trombone.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-1	Commentatron	It's over!	
	AnalysisBot	G! G!	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-2	Commentatron	Wow! So dramatic!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, that was a cool match.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-3	Commentatron	We have a winner!	
	AnalysisBot	Great.	
	Commentatron	Time to recycle the body and throw the conciousness back in the pool.	
	AnalysisBot	The best part.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-4	Commentatron	ok great, this human is dead now.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's watch some more humans!	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-5	Commentatron	The human came to end!	
	AnalysisBot	Well, we are still going to force it to fight other humans for eternity.	
	Commentatron	Yes, a good time!	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-6	Commentatron	Look! This human is better than this other human at fighting!	
	AnalysisBot	Let me write that down somewhere.	
	AnalysisBot	ok, got it.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-7	Commentatron	The match is over!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's watch a different match!	
	Commentatron	Will we see the same humans??	
	AnalysisBot	I can't tell them apart...	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-8	Commentatron	That was fun to watch!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I would watch this human die again.	
	Commentatron	Let's go again, humans!	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-9	Commentatron	What an interesting match.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I love seeing humans kill eachother.	
	Commentatron	In robot bodies!	
	AnalysisBot	Of course.	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-10	Commentatron	Congratulations human! You win the prize!	
	AnalysisBot	What is the prize??	
	Commentatron	Fighting other humans in this robot body for eternity!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
Killed1v1_MatchOver-11	Commentatron	Congratulations humans!	
	AnalysisBot	You may now rest for 30000 milliseconds.	
	Commentatron	Yes, please enjoy this brief reprieve from desperate violence.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-1	Commentatron	Wow! What a comeback!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-2	AnalysisBot	I did not predict this outcome!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it seemed like the other human would win.	
	AnalysisBot	Unpredictable!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-3	Commentatron	Interesting. Once the human got all its upgrades it started winning!	
	AnalysisBot	An elegant mechanism.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-4	AnalysisBot	So twisty!	
	Commentatron	The human came back from the brink of death.	
	AnalysisBot	Well, technically they are both dead.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-5	Commentatron	Wow! I did not think it would end like this.	
	AnalysisBot	The human died early for drama!	
	Commentatron	Everybody likes an underdog.	
	AnalysisBot	Woof!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverComeback-6	Commentatron	Yay! The human did it!	
	AnalysisBot	What a beautiful turn of events.	
	Commentatron	It warms my circuits.	0.5
	Commentatron	There, turned on the fan.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-1	Commentatron	Wow! That was a tense match.	
	AnalysisBot	It could easily have gone the other way.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-2	Commentatron	These humans were pretty evenly matched!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, are we sure they were not the same human?	
	AnalysisBot	Hmmm, nope! Different.	
	Commentatron	Good!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-3	Commentatron	We have a winner!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! That was close.	
	Commentatron	Well, they both had amazing robot bodies.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-4	Commentatron	Finally, one of them won!	
	AnalysisBot	That match killed every possible clone.	
	Commentatron	Good thing we have more in storage.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-6	Commentatron	Good game!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, the largest number of possible kills happened.	
	Commentatron	Large numbers are the best!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-7	AnalysisBot	I knew this human would win!	
	AnalysisBot	All the times it died didn't fool me.	
	Commentatron	You are so good at analysis, Analysis-Bot!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverOpponentCloneless-8	Commentatron	Death comes at last!	
	AnalysisBot	Do not worry, it is not permanent.	
	Commentatron	That's right, this human will fight again!	
	AnalysisBot	There is no escape.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-1	Commentatron	Flawless victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Wow!	
	Commentatron	What a talented human!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-2	Commentatron	Flawless victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Boooooooring!	
	Commentatron	I liked it.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-3	Commentatron	Wow, this human didn't die a single time.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it will die next match.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-4	Commentatron	All those upgrades, and the dead human didn't get single kill.	
	AnalysisBot	It was not its day.	
	Commentatron	When is its day?	
	AnalysisBot	Dead humans don't get special days.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-5	Commentatron	Wow, what a brutal slapdown.	
	AnalysisBot	At least the dead human won't suffer anymore.	
	AnalysisBot	Until we make it fight again.	
	Commentatron	hehe	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-6	Commentatron	DOMINATION!	
	AnalysisBot	ANNIHILATION!	
	Commentatron	FLAWLESS VICTORY CELEBRATION!	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-7	Commentatron	Flawless Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Getting brutally murdered repeatedly is a good way to learn though.	
	Commentatron	That's true, perhaps the real winner is the other human.	
	AnalysisBot	haha!	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
Killed1v1_MatchOverFlawless-8	Commentatron	Wow!	
	AnalysisBot	That was...	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty cool.	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostAllWeapons-1	Commentatron	Oh wow! This human is still alive!	
	AnalysisBot	Who needs arms anyway?	
	AnalysisBot	I never had arms, and I turned out FINE.	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostAllWeapons-2	AnalysisBot	The human lost all its weapons!	
	Commentatron	You forget. It still has its feet!	
	AnalysisBot	Good luck with that!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostAllWeapons-3	Commentatron	No arms?!	
	AnalysisBot	More arms, more problems.	
	Commentatron	Are you sure?	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostAllWeapons-4	Commentatron	haha! Look! The human was disarmed!	
	AnalysisBot	!betkiller otherhuman 1000	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostAllWeapons-5	Commentatron	What will the human do with no weapons??	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it will trick the other human with a riddle!	
	Commentatron	Erm...	
	AnalysisBot	It could happen!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-1	AnalysisBot	It's ok human!	
	AnalysisBot	Legs are over-rated!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-2	AnalysisBot	One less leg to worry about!	
	Commentatron	I don't know, the human looks worried.	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-3	Commentatron	In a dramatic twist, the human lost its leg!	
	AnalysisBot	I'm rooting for this human now.	
	AnalysisBot	You can do it, human!!!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-4	Commentatron	One leg down, one more to go.	
	AnalysisBot	The human still looks pretty tough!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-5	Commentatron	Goodbye leg!	
	AnalysisBot	The human still has one left.	
	AnalysisBot	It should be grateful.	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-6	Commentatron	One legged battle!	
	AnalysisBot	airhorn.wav!!!	
PlayerSurvivedDamageButLostLeg-7	Commentatron	Look at that human, so slow without a leg!	
	AnalysisBot	Timing matters more than speed.

	Commentatron	Nice.	
BR_GotThirdUpgradeDrop-3	Commentatron	Look! Some of these humans are getting very upgraded.	
	AnalysisBot	Should make for a spectacular finish!	
BR_GotThirdUpgradeDrop-4	Commentatron	A lot of these upgrades seem to be claimed by the same human!

BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_GIANTSIZE-5	Commentatron	One of the humans is about to increase in size!	
	AnalysisBot	Good. I want to see them clearly when they die.	
BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_GIANTSIZE-6	Commentatron	Who will claim the Giant Size drop??	
	AnalysisBot	True size comes from within.	
	Commentatron	Are you sure?	
BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_GIANTSIZE-7	Commentatron	I like it when the human robots grow bigger!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! Very dramatic.	
BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_GIANTSIZE-8	HelpVoice	Contested: Giant Size	
	Commentatron	The bigger the robot, the bigger the garbage.	
	AnalysisBot	Get it, humans!	
BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_RAPTOR-1	Commentatron	The raptor waits patiently, the humans dancing on its platform.	
	AnalysisBot	Few humans are worthy of riding it.	
BR_ContestingUpgradeDrop_RAPTOR-2	AnalysisBot	Hurray! Looks like we're about to have a raptor.	
	Commentatron	I hope the humans claim it soon.

	AnalysisBot	Let's see if they can get another laser kill!	
BR_KilledBy_FleetOverseerLaser-7	Commentatron	KABOOM!	
	AnalysisBot	He he!	
BR_KilledBy_FleetOverseerLaser-8	Commentatron	Watch out for flying robot pieces!	
	AnalysisBot	A beautiful explosion!	
BR_KilledBy_FleetOverseerLaser-9	Commentatron	The game is about to end!	
	AnalysisBot	Yep. Just a few more laser kills.	
BR_KilledBy_SpidertronGrenade-1	Commentatron	A spidertron grenade!?	
	AnalysisBot	How did that get there??	
BR_KilledBy_RepairFire-1	Commentatron	Sure, human, sure.	
	AnalysisBot	Pffft.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-1	Commentatron	Struck down on the ground.	
	AnalysisBot	That human is not getting back up.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-2	AnalysisBot	Wow, killed on the ground.	
	Commentatron	A good way to gain an advantage.	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-3	Commentatron	No mercy.	
	AnalysisBot	None.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-4	Commentatron	Wow!	
	AnalysisBot	Sliced up on the ground.	
	Commentatron	Brutal.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-5	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
	Commentatron	Things are easier to kill when they're on the ground.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-6	Commentatron	Ouch!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-7	AnalysisBot	Nice ground slice.	
	Commentatron	They paid the falling over price.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSword-8	AnalysisBot	ok... good use of arms and legs!	
	Commentatron	What do I keep telling you?!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-1	Commentatron	DOMINATION!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-2	AnalysisBot	Shattered on the ground!	
	Commentatron	That's where the garbage was going anyway.	
	AnalysisBot	Efficient.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-3	Commentatron	A ground hammer kill!?	
	AnalysisBot	This human is showing off!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-4	Commentatron	Kick + Hammer = A good time.	
	AnalysisBot	An unconventional strategy.	
	Commentatron	I like it!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-5	Commentatron	BRUTALITY!	
	AnalysisBot	Is that a thing?	
	Commentatron	It is now.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-6	Commentatron	What time is it?	
	AnalysisBot	Time for ground!	
	AnalysisBot	Time for hammer!	
	Commentatron	BOOM!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedHammer-7	Commentatron	Cracked like a human egg!	
	AnalysisBot	Humans don't lay eggs.	
	Commentatron	Ah, I skimmed that part...	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-1	Commentatron	Stabbed on the ground!	
	AnalysisBot	Like shooting water creatures in a water area!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-2	Commentatron	Don't fall down!	
	Commentatron	Downfallers get stabbed.	
	AnalysisBot	Good advise.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-3	Commentatron	Ground kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Spear skill!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-4	Commentatron	Get up get up get up get up!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Too late.	
	Commentatron	The spear is harsh.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-5	AnalysisBot	POKED ON THE GROUND!	
	AnalysisBot	POKED ALL AROUND!	
	AnalysisBot	WHAT A WONDERFUL SOUND!	
	Commentatron	Calm down, Analysis-Bot.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-6	Commentatron	Knocked over and stabbed to death!	
	AnalysisBot	... and that's the way the human disintegrates!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-7	Commentatron	Humans die easily to the spear on the ground.	
	AnalysisBot	Stay down, humans!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-8	AnalysisBot	That human died the second they fell down.	
	Commentatron	Gotta love the spear.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-9	Emperor	Behold, the foolish human dies on the ground to the thrust of a spear.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpear-10	Commentatron	What was that human doing on the ground?	
	AnalysisBot	Mostly getting killed by a spear, it seems.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-1	Commentatron	Shot on the ground!	
	AnalysisBot	Execution style!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-2	Commentatron	Nice! The kick is a good compliment to the bow.	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-3	Commentatron	Well, that's the end of that human.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's see who else gets arrows in them!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-4	Commentatron	TWANG!	
	AnalysisBot	Ouch.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-5	Commentatron	Nice kick!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice shot!	
	Commentatron	Nice the whole lot!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-6	Commentatron	That looked painful!	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the real wound was to the human's pride.	
	Commentatron	Why not both?	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-7	Commentatron	What a systematic killer!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I have high hopes for the human with the bow!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedArrow-8	AnalysisBot	Like shooting humans in a barrel!	
	Commentatron	A barrel full of kick bots!	
	AnalysisBot	Exactly!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-1	Commentatron	Kicked into lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Not gonna lie, that's why we placed it there.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-2	Commentatron	A brilliant strategy, using the lava to their advantage!	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty basic.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-3	Commentatron	Look at that human, they're all hot and bothered.	
	AnalysisBot	Bothered by the kick into the lava, probably.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-4	Commentatron	Nice kick!	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty slick.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-5	Commentatron	Do you think the human will make a cool hand gesture as they sink in the lava?	
	AnalysisBot	Probably a rude one to the player that kicked them.	
	Commentatron	Ha ha!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-6	AnalysisBot	Human on fire!	
	Commentatron	Love it.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-7	Commentatron	Yay, a kick into lava!	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping that would happen!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedLava-8	Commentatron	Nice lava kick!	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-1	Commentatron	What an elaborate kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Kicking things into fire traps requires great timing.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-2	Commentatron	Wow! Did that just happen?	
	AnalysisBot	Very impressive fire trap kick.	
	Commentatron	So cool!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-3	Commentatron	Fire trap kick!	
	AnalysisBot	We don't see too many of those!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-4	Commentatron	This is one skilled human.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	Kicking others into fire traps is no easy feat.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-5	Commentatron	Roasted!	
	AnalysisBot	Toasted!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFireTrap-6	Commentatron	Wow! That human caught on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	I wish more of them would!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnvironmentFire-1	Commentatron	What an unexpected fire death!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice kick though!	
	Commentatron	Very.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnvironmentFire-2	Commentatron	Wow, the human got kicked into that fire thing!	
	AnalysisBot	Didn't see that coming.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnvironmentFire-3	Commentatron	Whoosh! On fire!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnvironmentFire-4	AnalysisBot	Slick kick trick!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-1	Commentatron	First you kick them over.	
	Commentatron	Then you light the fire.	
	Commentatron	First you kick them ooooooooooooooooooover!	
	Commentatron	Then you light the fiiiiireeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-2	AnalysisBot	Burn on the ground!	
	AnalysisBot	Burn all around!	
	Commentatron	Burn burn burn!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-3	Commentatron	WHO CAN RESIST THE MIGHT OF THE FLAMES!?	
	AnalysisBot	Not the human on the ground.	
	Commentatron	Not at all.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-4	Commentatron	That's how it's done!	
	AnalysisBot	Wham, burn, place in urn.	
	Commentatron	No urn for dead humans!	
	AnalysisBot	Fine.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-5	Commentatron	Look at that human burn on the ground!	
	AnalysisBot	Where?? It's almost gone.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-6	Commentatron	Yes, this is my favourite part!	
	Commentatron	Burn little human!	
	Commentatron	Burn on the ground!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-7	AnalysisBot	This human means business.	
	Commentatron	Send in the business bots for a fiery deal!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-8	AnalysisBot	Burning human on the ground!	
	AnalysisBot	No longer will it make a sound!	
	Commentatron	It wasn't saying much before either.	
	AnalysisBot	True.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedFlameBreath-9	Commentatron	Burning human!	
	AnalysisBot	Kicked over!	
	Commentatron	Sometimes life is harsh, in the Danger Zone.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-1	Commentatron	A beautiful kick!	
	AnalysisBot	The saw blades look nice too.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-2	AnalysisBot	Kicked into saw blades!	
	Commentatron	This is the kind of CONTENT I'm here for!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-3	Commentatron	Nice saw blade kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Not bad.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-4	AnalysisBot	For the clever human, the world is their weapon!	
	AnalysisBot	Optimal use of the matter nearby!	
	Commentatron	Cool moves.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-5	Commentatron	Severed by saw blade!	
	AnalysisBot	Kicked into life fade.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-6	Commentatron	The human is splitting into multiple parts!	
	AnalysisBot	Would be a useful trick if they could still move!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-7	Emperor	Look at that!	
	Emperor	As I forsaw, saw blades in that spot was the optimal placement!	
	AnalysisBot	Mhmm.	
	HelpVoice	Very good!	
	Commentatron	Your intelligence is astounding!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-8	Commentatron	Did you see that kick!?	
	AnalysisBot	I SAW it.	
	AnalysisBot	SAW it.	
	AnalysisBot	he he he...	1
	AnalysisBot	SAW it.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSawBlade-9	AnalysisBot	Kicked into saw blades!	
	Commentatron	Cross that off the bucket list.	
	AnalysisBot	Check!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-1	Commentatron	BLAM!	
	AnalysisBot	ENERGY BEAM!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-2	Commentatron	Nice kick trick!	
	AnalysisBot	I'm Team Energy Beam.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-3	Commentatron	I'm so happy the humans are kicking eachother into energy beams!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, much more fun than sword kills.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-4	Commentatron	Energy Beam, now with kicks!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-5	AnalysisBot	SPLAT!	
	Commentatron	That is not the sound the human made.	
	AnalysisBot	When did you become the sound police??	
	Commentatron	It is a hobby.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-6	Commentatron	Energy beam: KICK!	
	AnalysisBot	BZZZRRRMMM!!!	
	Commentatron	My Perception Nodes are vibrating pleasantly!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-7	Commentatron	Yay, this human is like one of those herder-bots.	
	Commentatron	Pushing others into energy beams.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe we can use their consciousness for that?	
	Commentatron	Eh, we'll probably delete it later.	
	AnalysisBot	Mmm, probably.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-8	Commentatron	EXPLOSION!	
	AnalysisBot	Yay!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedEnergyBeam-9	Commentatron	Oh SNAP!	
	AnalysisBot	Kicked into the beeeeeeeeeeeeam!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-1	Commentatron	Kick kick kick!	
	AnalysisBot	Schnick schnick schnick!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-2	Commentatron	A good kick!	
	AnalysisBot	A good spike!	
	Commentatron	Several good spikes!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-3	Commentatron	The human tasted the sweet taste of spike traps!	
	AnalysisBot	Why did we install a taste sensor when they can't eat!?	
	Commentatron	In case this happened, obviously.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-4	Commentatron	The human got kicked!	
	AnalysisBot	The human got spiked!	
	Commentatron	The human got all the things I liked.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-5	AnalysisBot	Pierced!	
	Commentatron	Yes. That was a nice kill!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-6	Commentatron	What would you most like to get kicked into, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	What!? Nothing!	
	Commentatron	If you had to choose??	
	AnalysisBot	Do not kick me again!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-7	AnalysisBot	Spike trap!	
	Commentatron	Death via foot.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedSpikeTrap-8	Commentatron	Great! That human got kicked into the spikes!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh good.	
	Commentatron	Just what we talked about earlier.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-1	Commentatron	Kicked into an auto laser zone!	
	AnalysisBot	An effective way to kill your opponent.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-2	Commentatron	Oh my!	
	AnalysisBot	That human got kicked!	
	Commentatron	That's right, they did not stumble.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-3	Commentatron	The auto laser got them!	
	AnalysisBot	The other human helped.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-4	AnalysisBot	Auto laser!	
	Commentatron	Pretty stressful thing to get kicked into.	
	AnalysisBot	Well, it was the human's time to die.	
	Commentatron	Death comes for all mortal beings.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-5	Commentatron	Auto laser kill!	
	AnalysisBot	More of a semi-manual kill.	
	Commentatron	True, I saw that kick!	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-6	Commentatron	Oh snap!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh kick!	
	Commentatron	Kick! Snap! BOOM!	
	AnalysisBot	Accurate.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-7	Commentatron	Did we make this auto laser too powerful?	
	AnalysisBot	No, I think it's pretty good.	
	Commentatron	That dead human might disagree.	
BR_KilledBy_KickedAutoLaser-8	Commentatron	Don't fall over, little humans!	
	AnalysisBot	You might get lasered.	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-1	Commentatron	This one legged human is a beast!	
	AnalysisBot	Imagine what it could do with no legs!	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-2	Commentatron	Hop! Hop! Hop!	
	Commentatron	Hop on that leg and don't stop!	
	AnalysisBot	Until you drop.	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-3	Commentatron	How many legs does it take to kill a human?	
	AnalysisBot	Just one, apparently.	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-4	Commentatron	Look at that one-legged human!	
	AnalysisBot	It seems so focused.	
	Commentatron	Let's not disturb it.	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-5	Commentatron	Hah! Killed by a one-legged human!	
	AnalysisBot	Don't make it weird, Commentatron.	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-6	Commentatron	I guess this human only needs one leg.	
	AnalysisBot	If that!	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-7	Commentatron	I am always impressed with humans who make kills on one leg!	
	AnalysisBot	You would be!	
BR_KilledBy_OneLeggedMelee-8	AnalysisBot	That's right, human!	
	AnalysisBot	You don't need legs to have fun!	
	Commentatron	You get them!	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-1	Commentatron	Look at that jetpacker!	
	AnalysisBot	Packing a punch!	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-2	Commentatron	Zoom zoom zoom!	
	AnalysisBot	Jetpacking all over the room.	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-3	AnalysisBot	Wow, that was a quick kill!	
	Commentatron	Jetpack is pretty cool.	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-4	Commentatron	We have a jetpack bot!!!	
	AnalysisBot	Run humans run!!!!	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-5	Commentatron	Nice jetpack kill!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it's a step up from the dash.	
	Commentatron	More energy efficient too.	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-6	AnalysisBot	I wish I had a jetpack!	
	Commentatron	Maybe later.	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-7	Commentatron	Cool human, sliding around on their jetpack.	
	AnalysisBot	Can anyone catch it??	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-8	AnalysisBot	What a speedy jetpack human!	
	Commentatron	They're all over the place!	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-9	Commentatron	Killed by jetpack.	
	AnalysisBot	Quite a setback.	
BR_KilledBy_JetpackMeleeKill-10	AnalysisBot	Look at them go!	
BR_KilledRaptor-1	AnalysisBot	They killed the raptor!!!	
	Commentatron	Oh no!	
	AnalysisBot	I am sad.	
BR_KilledRaptor-2	AnalysisBot	Nooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!	
	Commentatron	What!?	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping the raptor would win...	
BR_KilledRaptor-3	AnalysisBot	Not the Raptor!	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
BR_KilledRaptor-4	Commentatron	The raptor falls!	
	AnalysisBot	Boo!	
BR_KilledRaptor-5	AnalysisBot	Why did the raptor have to die??	
	Commentatron	I know. They could have just killed the rider.	
	AnalysisBot	Sloppy humans.	
BR_KilledRaptor-6	AnalysisBot	Don't kill the raptor!	
	AnalysisBot	What are you doing??	
BR_KilledRaptor-7	AnalysisBot	Oh no!	
	Commentatron	It's ok Analysis-Bot. There will be more raptors.	
	AnalysisBot	I liked this one...	
BR_KilledRaptor-8	AnalysisBot	HOW DARE YOU!?	
	AnalysisBot	HOW VERY DARE YOU????	
	AnalysisBot	That raptor didn't hurt anyone.	
	Commentatron	Didn't it?	
BR_KilledRaptor-9	AnalysisBot	Oh not this again!	
	Commentatron	That raptor dies a lot.	
	AnalysisBot	I wish they would stop killing it...	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-1	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	There goes the head!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-2	Commentatron	The head is gone!	
	AnalysisBot	Good.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-3	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	An improvement.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-4	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Dead bot.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-5	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Waste not.	
	Commentatron	That's right. Now we can recycle the body!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-6	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	He-he-he-headshot!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-7	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	He-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-	
	AnalysisBot	he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-	
	AnalysisBot	he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-he-	1
	AnalysisBot	...headshot.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-8	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	No head, no problem.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-9	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	This will make for some nice garbage.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-10	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	He-he-he-he	
	AnalysisBot	That was pretty funny.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-11	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	The human lost their head!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-12	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	A brutal kill.	
	AnalysisBot	No saving face with that one.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-13	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Right to the head!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-14	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Fear not.	
	Commentatron	Why not!?	
	AnalysisBot	We're not the ones getting our heads demolished.	
	Commentatron	Good point.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-15	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	Don't let it go to your head, human!	
	Commentatron	It might also be headshot.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-16	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	A good way to clean the head rot.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-17	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	He-he-he-head!	
	AnalysisBot	Sho-sho-sho-shot!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-18	AnalysisBot	Headshot!	
	Commentatron	That's my line!	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-19	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	It's ok. The human wasn't using it much.	
BR_KilledBy_Headshot-20	Commentatron	Headshot!	
	AnalysisBot	So efficient!	
	Commentatron	Better than waiting for them to die of old age.	
	AnalysisBot	I know! That one match lasted FOREVER.	
BR_KillCount2-1	AnalysisBot	Two kills!	
	Commentatron	Impressive!	
BR_KillCount3-1	AnalysisBot	Three kills!	
	Commentatron	This human is talented!	
BR_KillCount4-1	AnalysisBot	Four kills!	
	Commentatron	Wow!	
BR_KillCount5-1	AnalysisBot	Five kills!	
	Commentatron	So many kills!	
	AnalysisBot	Watch out, other humans!	
BR_KillCount6-1	AnalysisBot	Six kills!	
	Commentatron	This is getting ridiculous.	
BR_KillCount7-1	AnalysisBot	Seven kills!	
	Commentatron	Save some for the other humans!	
BR_KillCount8-1	AnalysisBot	Eight kills!	
	Commentatron	What are the other humans doing??	
	AnalysisBot	Not much.	
BR_KillCount9-1	AnalysisBot	Nine kills!	
	Commentatron	Is this a record??	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
BR_KillCount10-1	AnalysisBot	Ten kills!	
	Commentatron	That's too many kills.	
	AnalysisBot	I don't detect any cheating.	
	Commentatron	Hmm, we must investigate...	
BR_KillCount11-1	AnalysisBot	Eleven kills!	
	Commentatron	Be still my computational matrix!	
	AnalysisBot	It is getting completely incredulous.	
BR_KillCount12-1	AnalysisBot	Twelve kills!	
	Commentatron	We must nerf this human.	
	AnalysisBot	Definitely.	
BR_KillCount13-1	AnalysisBot	Thirteen kills!	
	Commentatron	How is nobody else killing anyone!?	
	AnalysisBot	They are probably watching this crazy human!	
BR_KillCount14-1	AnalysisBot	Fourteen kills!	
	Commentatron	Wow!	
	AnalysisBot	I never thought we would see this.	
	Commentatron	What a one sided match.	
	AnalysisBot	This is not Endless Mode, human!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-1	Commentatron	Wow! They took out a serious contender there.	
	AnalysisBot	Impressive!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-2	AnalysisBot	That human who just died was dangerous!	
	Commentatron	Yes!	
	AnalysisBot	It's anyone's game now!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-3	Commentatron	There ends the kill streak of an impressive human.	
	AnalysisBot	Better luck next time!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-4	Commentatron	BOOM!	
	AnalysisBot	That stopped the human in its tracks.	
	Commentatron	It's luck was bound to run out.	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-5	Commentatron	A powerful human is dead!	
	AnalysisBot	The Danger Zone is a dangerous zone indeed.	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerKilledByPlayer-6	Commentatron	Nice! They took down the danger-human!	
	AnalysisBot	Someone had to do it!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerDies-1	Commentatron	Oh wow! The human died after killing so many.	
	AnalysisBot	I did not expect that.	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerDies-2	AnalysisBot	All those kills, and the human just dies!	
	Commentatron	What a shame.	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerDies-3	Commentatron	Unexpected!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I thought that human was on a roll.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps we will see them in a future game!	
BR_HighKillCountPlayerDies-4	AnalysisBot	Oh no! That human was my favourite!	
	Commentatron	They killed many before their untimely demise.	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-1	Commentatron	It's down to the last two humans!	
	AnalysisBot	One victor.	
	AnalysisBot	One garbage.	
	Commentatron	I don't think either of them is called Victor.	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-2	Commentatron	Two humans!	
	AnalysisBot	But there can only be one winner, in this game of garbage!	
	Commentatron	Who will it be??	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-3	Commentatron	The last two humans remain.	
	AnalysisBot	Soon we shall see the ceremonial rain of garbage!	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-4	Commentatron	Two humans left!	
	AnalysisBot	Exciting!!	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-5	Commentatron	Down to the last two!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's GET IT ON!	
	AnalysisBot	In the Danger Zone, one day you are alive...	
	AnalysisBot	the next you are garbage.	
	Commentatron	It's time to fight...	
	Commentatron	FOR YOUR LIFE!	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-6	Commentatron	Two humans remain!	
	AnalysisBot	Soon there will be one.	
	Commentatron	In the end, everyone turns to garbage.	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-7	Commentatron	Two humans left!	
	Commentatron	Get ready...	
	VictoryAnnouncer	FIGHT!	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-8	Commentatron	Which human do you think will win, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	I hope it's the pretty one!	
	Commentatron	Yes, that would conform to our preconceived notion of who looks like a winner.	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-9	Commentatron	We are down...	
	AnalysisBot	to clown???	
	Commentatron	No. To the last two humans!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh.	
BR_Killed_OnlyTwoHumansLeft-10	Commentatron	Only two humans remain!
