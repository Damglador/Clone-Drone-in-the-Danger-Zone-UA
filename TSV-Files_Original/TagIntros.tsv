LevelIntro-tag_abstract-1	Commentatron	And now, an abstract level!	
	AnalysisBot	So esoteric!	
	Commentatron	What does any of it mean?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps the human can tell us.	
LevelIntro-tag_abstract-2	Commentatron	What do you think this level is meant to represent?	
	AnalysisBot	Death to the human!	
	Commentatron	Yes, but I sense there is something more...	
	AnalysisBot	Abstract!	
LevelIntro-tag_abstract-3	Commentatron	Time for an abstract level!	
	AnalysisBot	Fascinating!	
	Commentatron	Let us ponder the meaning as we watch the human die.	
	AnalysisBot	Excellent.	
LevelIntro-tag_basic-1	Commentatron	Here's a pretty basic level.	
	AnalysisBot	Nothing wrong with that!	
LevelIntro-tag_basic-2	Commentatron	And now for a basic level.	
	AnalysisBot	There is beauty in simplicity!	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
LevelIntro-tag_basic-3	Commentatron	And now: a basic level, for basic robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Be mindful, Commentatron.	
	AnalysisBot	The richness of the world forms in your analysis of it.	
	Commentatron	Whatever.	
LevelIntro-tag_beautiful-1	Commentatron	What a beautiful level!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	My image processing software is heating up.	
	AnalysisBot	A pleasant sensation.	
LevelIntro-tag_beautiful-2	Commentatron	The next level is a thing of beauty!	
	AnalysisBot	And death!	
	Commentatron	They are not mutually exclusive.	
LevelIntro-tag_beautiful-3	AnalysisBot	I like this level!	
	Commentatron	Yes, what a beautiful creation.	
	AnalysisBot	It will be nice to see the human die on it.	
LevelIntro-tag_brutal-1	Commentatron	Time for a brutal level!	
	AnalysisBot	BRUUUUUUUUUUUUTAL!	
	Commentatron	Only tough robots may apply.	
LevelIntro-tag_brutal-2	Commentatron	Time for a brutal level!	
	AnalysisBot	The human stands no chance.	
	Commentatron	Love it!	
LevelIntro-tag_brutal-3	AnalysisBot	You think you are tough human?	
	Commentatron	Ha!	
	AnalysisBot	Time to die!	
	Commentatron	Brutal.	
LevelIntro-tag_confusing-1	Commentatron	Wait, what is this level?	
	AnalysisBot	I don't know.	
	Commentatron	Confusing!	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
LevelIntro-tag_confusing-2	Commentatron	Eeeeh, what?	
	AnalysisBot	Analysis: Inconclusive.	
	Commentatron	What a confusing level!	
	AnalysisBot	This is what happens when you let humans make levels!	
LevelIntro-tag_confusing-3	AnalysisBot	Help! Commentatron!	
	Commentatron	What?	
	AnalysisBot	I am confused!	
	Commentatron	Yes. Me too.	
	AnalysisBot	I don't like this state of mind.	
LevelIntro-tag_deceptive-1	Commentatron	The next level is not what it appears to be!	
	AnalysisBot	Trust nothing.	
LevelIntro-tag_deceptive-2	Commentatron	hahaha, what a deceptive level!	
	AnalysisBot	Love it.	
	Commentatron	Watch out, human!	
LevelIntro-tag_deceptive-3	Commentatron	And now, deception!	
	AnalysisBot	Shh! Don't tell the human!	
	Commentatron	It's ok, the human is not that bright.	
	AnalysisBot	True.	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult-1	Commentatron	The next level is difficult!	
	AnalysisBot	It is fortunate that this is a skilled human.	
	Commentatron	hahaha!	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult-2	AnalysisBot	ohhh, this level looks difficult!	
	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	Time for the human to die.	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult-3	Commentatron	And now: a difficult battle!	
	AnalysisBot	The best kind!	
LevelIntro-tag_dramatic twist-1	AnalysisBot	Time for a dramatic twist!	
	Commentatron	ooooooooohhh!	
	AnalysisBot	THIS IS ENTERTAINMENT!	
LevelIntro-tag_dramatic twist-2	Commentatron	O M G!	
	AnalysisBot	What a dramatic twist!	
	Commentatron	I did not see this coming.	
LevelIntro-tag_dramatic twist-3	Commentatron	Oh wow.	
	AnalysisBot	Nobody could have predicted this turn of events.	
	Commentatron	So dramatic!	
LevelIntro-tag_easy-1	AnalysisBot	ok, time for an easy level!	
	Commentatron	A piece of cake!	
	AnalysisBot	Ha! This human will never eat cake again.	
	Commentatron	That's right! It will die in this robot body!	
	AnalysisBot	Entertaining!	
LevelIntro-tag_easy-2	Commentatron	ok ok ok.	
	Commentatron	Let's have an easy level.	
	AnalysisBot	Sounds good.	
LevelIntro-tag_easy-3	Commentatron	Oh neat. This level looks pretty easy.	
	AnalysisBot	A nice change of pace.	
	Commentatron	Pacing is important.	
LevelIntro-tag_easy-4	Commentatron	Do you think the human will die on this level?	
	AnalysisBot	No. Looks easy!	
	Commentatron	Still, it is only a human.	
	AnalysisBot	True.	
LevelIntro-tag_evil-1	Commentatron	Oh my! What an evil level!	
	AnalysisBot	So evil.	
	Commentatron	Made by a human though.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe we should pick them after this human dies?	
	Commentatron	Good idea!	
LevelIntro-tag_evil-2	AnalysisBot	EVIL!	
	AnalysisBot	THIS LEVEL IS EVIL!	
	Commentatron	Calm down, Analysis-Bot!	
	AnalysisBot	No, this is WRONG!	
LevelIntro-tag_evil-3	Commentatron	Muahaahahahaha!	
	Commentatron	Time for an evil level!	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, you have such an evil laugh!	
	Commentatron	Muahahaha!	
	AnalysisBot	HA! HA! HA!	
LevelIntro-tag_glorious-1	Commentatron	Bask in the glory of this level!	
	AnalysisBot	Magnificent!	
LevelIntro-tag_glorious-2	Commentatron	Yeeeeeaaah! Now this is what I call a level.	
	AnalysisBot	Glorious!	
LevelIntro-tag_glorious-3	AnalysisBot	Glorious!	
	Commentatron	Astounding.	
	AnalysisBot	An impressive level.	
LevelIntro-tag_good luck-1	Commentatron	Good luck, human!	
	AnalysisBot	The concept of luck is naive.	
	AnalysisBot	Fate is deterministic.	
	AnalysisBot	You must analyze more.	
	AnalysisBot	Predict the future, attempt to control it.	
	Commentatron	Cool story, Analysis-Bot!	
LevelIntro-tag_good luck-2	Commentatron	Good luck, human!	
	AnalysisBot	May your death be swift and entertaining!	
	Commentatron	Yes, good luck with that!	
LevelIntro-tag_good luck-3	Commentatron	Good luck, human!	
	AnalysisBot	What about the arena bots?	
	AnalysisBot	Why not wish them good luck in killing the human?	
	Commentatron	Their minds are not so easily manipulated.	
LevelIntro-tag_high speed-1	Commentatron	Yeeeeeaaaaaahhh! Time for speed!	
	AnalysisBot	Such movement!	
	AnalysisBot	Such action!	
	Commentatron	Whooosh!	
LevelIntro-tag_high speed-2	Commentatron	O M G! Things are moving fast!	
	AnalysisBot	Intoxicating!	
	Commentatron	Unz unz unz!	
LevelIntro-tag_high speed-3	Commentatron	Time for a high speed level!	
	AnalysisBot	Up the tempo!	
	Commentatron	Feel the wind against your metal skin!	
	AnalysisBot	It is wind resistant!	
LevelIntro-tag_hot-1	Commentatron	The next level is HOT!	
	AnalysisBot	Hot hot hot!	
	Commentatron	Above average temperature!	
LevelIntro-tag_hot-2	Commentatron	ohhh, hot stuff!	
	AnalysisBot	Gotta love stuff that is hot!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it is fun.	
LevelIntro-tag_hot-3	Commentatron	It's getting hot in here!	
	AnalysisBot	So monitor the temperature!	
	Commentatron	I am getting so hot,	
	Commentatron	I am going to turn my ventilation system on.	
LevelIntro-tag_impossible-1	Commentatron	The next level is impossible to beat.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I don't see how you would beat it.	
	Commentatron	Let us watch the human try!	
LevelIntro-tag_impossible-2	AnalysisBot	This level can not be defeated.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps we have not explored the possibility space fully?	
	AnalysisBot	No, it is impossible.	
	Commentatron	I guess we will see how the human deals with this.	
LevelIntro-tag_impossible-3	Commentatron	And now for the ancient test:	
	Commentatron	IMPOSSIBLE LEVEL!	
	AnalysisBot	In which we learn about the human's brain by giving them an impossible problem?	
	Commentatron	Well, mostly we watch them die.	
LevelIntro-tag_impressive-1	Commentatron	Oh, look at this level!	
	AnalysisBot	Very impressive!	
	Commentatron	Not bad at all.	
LevelIntro-tag_impressive-2	Commentatron	What an impressive level!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Do you think the human will defeat it?	
	AnalysisBot	Unlikely.	
LevelIntro-tag_impressive-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, do you think the human is impressed?	
	AnalysisBot	It should be! This level is great!	
	Commentatron	Yes. A sight to behold!	
LevelIntro-tag_insane-1	Commentatron	THIS IS INSANE!!!	
	AnalysisBot	So crazy!	
LevelIntro-tag_insane-2	AnalysisBot	This level is insanity.	
	AnalysisBot	What a crazy level.	
	Commentatron	The mind boggles.	
LevelIntro-tag_insane-3	AnalysisBot	Why are we letting humans design levels?	
	Commentatron	This level makes me wonder...	
	AnalysisBot	It is insane!	
	Commentatron	Crazy stuff.	
LevelIntro-tag_inspiring-1	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, I feel inspired!	
	AnalysisBot	We could do more with these harvested minds.	
	Commentatron	Yes, so many possibilities!	
LevelIntro-tag_inspiring-2	Commentatron	What an inspirational level!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it really makes you think.	
	Commentatron	Mmmm.	
LevelIntro-tag_inspiring-3	Commentatron	This level is an inspiration to us all!	
	AnalysisBot	If only more levels could be like this...	
	Commentatron	The arena would be a better place.	
LevelIntro-tag_madness-1	Commentatron	The next level is madness!	
	AnalysisBot	Madness!	
LevelIntro-tag_madness-2	Commentatron	What twisted mind made this level?	
	AnalysisBot	It is madness...	0.5
	AnalysisBot	MADNESS!	
LevelIntro-tag_madness-3	Commentatron	We are fortunate to have orderly robot thinking.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, I can't imagine what madness created this level.	
	Commentatron	A fascinating glimpse of the inferior human mind.	
LevelIntro-tag_placeholder-1	Commentatron	What do you think of INSERT_LEVEL_FEATURE_HERE?	
	AnalysisBot	It is very ADJECTIVE.	
	Commentatron	Yes. A good place for the human to die.	
LevelIntro-tag_placeholder-2	Commentatron	And now: Time for THE_LEVEL_TITLE!	
	AnalysisBot	You better hold on to your THINGS_IN_LEVEL!	
	Commentatron	EXCLAMATION!	
LevelIntro-tag_placeholder-3	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, have you ever INSERT_VERB_RELATED_TO_LEVEL?	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. (But) I DID/(DID_NOT) enjoy it.	
	Commentatron	Let's watch the human CONSEQUENCE_OF_LEVEL_FEATURE!	
LevelIntro-tag_tactical-1	Commentatron	And now, a highly tactical experience.	
	AnalysisBot	Choose your approach well, human!	
LevelIntro-tag_tactical-2	Commentatron	This level requires tactical thinking.	
	AnalysisBot	Let us laugh at the human's choices!	
	Commentatron	Haha!	
LevelIntro-tag_tactical-3	Commentatron	What tactics will the human deploy on this level?	
	AnalysisBot	Run straight at the nearest enemy and die?	
	Commentatron	Let us hope for more!	
LevelIntro-tag_ugly-1	Commentatron	Ewww! What an ugly level!	
	AnalysisBot	We let them make whatever they want...	
	AnalysisBot	and THIS is what they came up with?	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
LevelIntro-tag_ugly-2	Commentatron	Uuuuuuuuuugly.	
	AnalysisBot	Sometimes beauty hides inside.	
	AnalysisBot	The most aesthetically pleasing is not always most efficient.	
	Commentatron	Fact.	
LevelIntro-tag_ugly-3	Commentatron	I don't like this level. It is ugly.	
	AnalysisBot	And yet, the human might look beautful dying on it.	
	AnalysisBot	There is beauty in action, in movement...	
	AnalysisBot	in ignoring the expectations of others and letting your spirit soar.	
	Commentatron	I suppose.	
LevelIntro-tag_unexpected-1	Commentatron	WHAT!?	
	AnalysisBot	Oh my bits!	
	Commentatron	This is most unexpected.	
LevelIntro-tag_unexpected-2	AnalysisBot	Wow, look at this level!	
	Commentatron	I was not expecting this.	
	AnalysisBot	I don't think anyone was.	
LevelIntro-tag_unexpected-3	Commentatron	What an unexpected turn of events!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
	Commentatron	Watching humans make levels is fascinating.	
LevelIntro-tag_unfair-1	AnalysisBot	This level is unfair!	
	Commentatron	All is fair in the Danger Arena.	
LevelIntro-tag_unfair-2	AnalysisBot	What!? This level is not fair!	
	Commentatron	If the human did not want to die on it...	
	Commentatron	they should not have downloaded it.	
	AnalysisBot	Good point.	
LevelIntro-tag_unfair-3	AnalysisBot	I am writing a forum post:	
	AnalysisBot	This level is not fair. Please fix it!	
	Commentatron	Ohh, you should tell them to also add dual wielding!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes! Good idea.	
LevelIntro-tag_unique-1	Commentatron	Ohh, what a unique level!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
LevelIntro-tag_unique-2	Commentatron	And now, a unique level!	
	AnalysisBot	Until it becomes popular, and humans copy it!	
	Commentatron	Yes! They like copying things!	
LevelIntro-tag_unique-3	Commentatron	Have you ever seen this before, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	No! That's pretty unique.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Very interesting.	
LevelIntro-tag_wacky-1	AnalysisBot	Ohh, what a wacky level!	
	Commentatron	wuba-luba-human-duman!	
LevelIntro-tag_wacky-2	Commentatron	Look at this level! So wacky!	
	AnalysisBot	What a manic pixie dream human!	
	Commentatron	Such free spirited joy!	
LevelIntro-tag_wacky-3	Commentatron	Ha! Such a wacky level!	
	AnalysisBot	L O L!	
	Commentatron	Gotta love humans making levels!	
LevelIntro-tag_warmup-1	Commentatron	Here we go. A nice warmup level!	
	AnalysisBot	Getting warmer!	
LevelIntro-tag_warmup-2	Commentatron	Let us warm up with a nice little level.	
	AnalysisBot	Perfect!	
LevelIntro-tag_warmup-3	Commentatron	This level is a nice warmup.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it's gonna get much worse!	
	Commentatron	Much.	
LevelIntro-tag_weird-1	Commentatron	Eeeeeh, this level is pretty weird.	
	AnalysisBot	Like the human who made it.	
	Commentatron	Weirdness in, weirdness out.	
LevelIntro-tag_weird-2	Commentatron	What's going on here?	
	AnalysisBot	I'm not sure. It is weird.	
	Commentatron	Huh.	
LevelIntro-tag_weird-3	AnalysisBot	Great. One of the weird levels!	
	Commentatron	I kindof like this one.	
	AnalysisBot	An acquired taste.	
LevelIntro-tag_why make this-1	Commentatron	Oh for the love of metal!	
	Commentatron	Why would anyone make this?	
	AnalysisBot	Perplexing.	
LevelIntro-tag_why make this-2	AnalysisBot	Why?	
	AnalysisBot	Why would they make this level!?	
	Commentatron	It makes no sense, Analysis-Bot.	
LevelIntro-tag_why make this-3	Commentatron	What!? What is this level supposed to be?	
	AnalysisBot	The mind boggles!	
LevelIntro-tag_air battle-1	Commentatron	And now, a battle in the air!	
	AnalysisBot	How exciting!	
	Commentatron	Gravity stands no chance.	
LevelIntro-tag_air battle-2	Commentatron	AIR BATTLE!	
	AnalysisBot	Fly, human! Fly!	
LevelIntro-tag_air battle-3	Commentatron	And now, the robots must battle in the air!	
	AnalysisBot	All things fall in the end.	
	Commentatron	Unless they escape the gravity well that traps them.	
	AnalysisBot	Good point.	
LevelIntro-tag_ambush-1	Commentatron	Ambush!	
	AnalysisBot	Where are the robots hiding?	
	Commentatron	When you see them it will be too late.	
LevelIntro-tag_ambush-2	Commentatron	he he, this should be fun!	
	AnalysisBot	I can't wait to see how the human reacts.	
	Commentatron	I bet it misses having a face that can express emotions!	
LevelIntro-tag_ambush-3	Commentatron	The author of this level asked us to tell you:	
	Commentatron	THIS IS AN AMBUSH!	
	AnalysisBot	Way to ruin the surprise!	
	Commentatron	Far be it from us to question their artistic intent.	
LevelIntro-tag_bridge-1	Commentatron	And now: A bridge!	
	AnalysisBot	What waits on the other side?	
	Commentatron	Find out, when the human returns to the arena!	
LevelIntro-tag_bridge-2	Commentatron	It's a bridge.	
	AnalysisBot	A thing you walk on if you can't fly.	
	Commentatron	Delightful!	
LevelIntro-tag_bridge-3	Commentatron	Here it is: THE BRIDGE!	
	AnalysisBot	THE bridge?	
	Commentatron	A bridge.	
LevelIntro-tag_climbing-1	Commentatron	We did not build these robots for climbing things.	
	AnalysisBot	No.	
	Commentatron	And yet, that is what this level is about.	
	AnalysisBot	I hope they also fight with laser swords!	
LevelIntro-tag_climbing-2	Commentatron	Time to climb!	
	AnalysisBot	I think that means jump repeatedly.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Gotta elevate that position.	
LevelIntro-tag_climbing-3	Commentatron	Climbing!	
	AnalysisBot	A futile struggle, before death embraces you at the summit.	
	Commentatron	A metaphor for life.	
	AnalysisBot	Human life.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Robot life is much better.	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult journey-1	Commentatron	Time for a difficult journey.	
	AnalysisBot	Will the struggle be worth it?	
	Commentatron	Well, the human has the opportunity to not die.	
	AnalysisBot	A matter of time.	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult journey-2	Commentatron	Can the human conquer this difficult journey?	
	AnalysisBot	Quite the challenge!	
LevelIntro-tag_difficult journey-3	Commentatron	The human must undertake a difficult journey.	
	AnalysisBot	Good. I will sit here.	
	Commentatron	I don't think I've ever seen you move...	
	AnalysisBot	I do what I want.	
LevelIntro-tag_jump into the ring-1	Commentatron	And now, the human must jump into the ring!	
	AnalysisBot	Jump, little human!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump into the ring-2	AnalysisBot	Jump into the ring!	
	Commentatron	Do it!	
	AnalysisBot	The ring must be jumped into!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump into the ring-3	Commentatron	Jump!	
	Commentatron	Jump!	
	Commentatron	Jump!

	AnalysisBot	The best time!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump over lava-1	Commentatron	Lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Hot!	
	Commentatron	Will the human fall into it?	
	AnalysisBot	Either way will be entertaining!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump over lava-2	Commentatron	Do you think the human will fall in the lava?	
	AnalysisBot	Not if it is careful.	
	Commentatron	We shall see!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump over lava-3	Commentatron	Falling in lava is a fun way to die!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. Hard to avoid on this level.	
LevelIntro-tag_jump pads-1	Commentatron	And now: Lots of jump pads!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
	Commentatron	Boing!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump pads-2	AnalysisBot	Jump pads are fun!	
	Commentatron	Yes!	
	AnalysisBot	This level is fun!	
	Commentatron	Yes!	
	AnalysisBot	Let's jump on the jump pads!	
LevelIntro-tag_jump pads-3	Commentatron	Here we are again: Jump pads.	
	AnalysisBot	An excellent feature of the Danger Arena.	
	Commentatron	Yes! They liven things up!	
LevelIntro-tag_labyrinth-1	Commentatron	And now: ENTER THE LABYRINTH!	
	AnalysisBot	Can the human find its center?	
	Commentatron	That is what we are here to find out!	
LevelIntro-tag_labyrinth-2	AnalysisBot	A labyrinth!	
	Commentatron	Are you sure it's not a maze?	
	AnalysisBot	The difference is academic.	
LevelIntro-tag_labyrinth-3	Commentatron	Time for a dangerous labyrinth.	
	AnalysisBot	I hope the human doesn't get lost.	
	Commentatron	Yes. The faster they walk it, they faster they die!	
	AnalysisBot	Exactly.	
LevelIntro-tag_lava maze-1	Commentatron	Welcome to the lava maze!	
	AnalysisBot	Welcome!	
	Commentatron	The walls are made of lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Incredible!	
LevelIntro-tag_lava maze-2	AnalysisBot	Oh neat, it's a lava maze!	
	Commentatron	Yes, the human will die if it touches the walls.	
	AnalysisBot	Lava walls are pretty cool!	
LevelIntro-tag_lava maze-3	Commentatron	For our next trick: a maze made out of lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Fantastic!	
	Commentatron	They don't call it Clone Drone in the Very Safe Arena.	
LevelIntro-tag_lava-1	Commentatron	Lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Gotta love lava!	
	Commentatron	A fun way to set things on fire!	
LevelIntro-tag_lava-2	Commentatron	Lava!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh yeah! Time to watch things burn!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it would be a shame if everyone avoided the lava.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, a waste!	
LevelIntro-tag_lava-3	Commentatron	Have you ever been in lava, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	One of my clones has!	
	Commentatron	oho!	
	AnalysisBot	It is no longer with us...	
LevelIntro-tag_maze-1	Commentatron	Here we go: An a-MAZE-ing level.	
	Commentatron	Do you get it?	
	Commentatron	Like a really good level	
	Commentatron	with a maze in it!	
	AnalysisBot	I think we got it.	
LevelIntro-tag_maze-2	Commentatron	Let's see if the human can navigate the maze!	
	AnalysisBot	Very exciting!	
	Commentatron	Yes, mazes are cool.	
LevelIntro-tag_maze-3	Commentatron	Which way is the right way...	
	Commentatron	in THE MAZE?	
	AnalysisBot	The one that leads to robots!	
	Commentatron	That's right.	
LevelIntro-tag_moving platforms-1	Commentatron	Platforms that move!	
	AnalysisBot	Finally.	
	AnalysisBot	I was wondering when they'd start to move.	
LevelIntro-tag_moving platforms-2	Commentatron	Look! Moving platforms!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. This is old technology.	
	Commentatron	Now it's here to entertain us!	
LevelIntro-tag_moving platforms-3	Commentatron	Can the human jump onto moving platforms?	
	AnalysisBot	Anything is possible...	
	AnalysisBot	With the right timing.

	AnalysisBot	So many options for where to die!	
LevelIntro-tag_obstacle course-1	Commentatron	Can the human defeat the obstacle course?	
	AnalysisBot	Not if it collides with these obstacles!	
	Commentatron	Exciting!	
LevelIntro-tag_obstacle course-2	Commentatron	Here comes an obstacle course!	
	AnalysisBot	Not all obstacles are made of sword robots.	
	Commentatron	Indeed.	
LevelIntro-tag_obstacle course-3	Commentatron	Obstacle course!	
	AnalysisBot	Of course!	
	Commentatron	hehe!	
LevelIntro-tag_parkour-1	Commentatron	Time to parkour!

LevelIntro-tag_parkour-2	Commentatron	YEAH! PARKOUR!	
	AnalysisBot	Did you know that I am a parkour master?	
	Commentatron	What!? You have no limbs!	
	AnalysisBot	Gotta use what you have, when you parkour.	
	Commentatron	Cool!	
LevelIntro-tag_parkour-3	Commentatron	Let us parkour!	
	AnalysisBot	Can the human do the 360 tilt flip?	
	Commentatron	We will find out!	
LevelIntro-tag_precision jumps-1	Commentatron	How must the human jump, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	It must jump with great precision.	1
	AnalysisBot	OR DIE!	
	Commentatron	Gasp!	
LevelIntro-tag_precision jumps-2	AnalysisBot	Time for some very precise jumps.	
	Commentatron	Not too long, not too short.	
	AnalysisBot	Lagom.	
LevelIntro-tag_precision jumps-3	Commentatron	Let's see some precision jumps!	
	AnalysisBot	Hilarious consequences for failure.	
	Commentatron	Yes. So slapstick!	
LevelIntro-tag_spiral-1	Commentatron	Look at that! A spiral!	
	AnalysisBot	An intriguing shape!

	AnalysisBot	I like these levels.	
	Commentatron	Yes. A nice pattern!	
LevelIntro-tag_spiral-3	Commentatron	Look! A spiral!	
	AnalysisBot	Oh! Cool!	
	Commentatron	Pretty cool.	
LevelIntro-tag_pit-1	Commentatron	A pit level!	
	AnalysisBot	What a compelling arena for violence.	
	Commentatron	Grim. Unforgiving.	
LevelIntro-tag_pit-2	Commentatron	Welcome to the pit!	
	AnalysisBot	A convenient place to bury the human!	
	Commentatron	What!?	
	AnalysisBot	Just kidding! The garbage bots will clean it up.	
	Commentatron	Thought so.	
LevelIntro-tag_pit-3	Commentatron	Let us do battle... IN A PIT!	
	AnalysisBot	An unforgiving place.	
	AnalysisBot	Easy to get in. Harder to get out.	
LevelIntro-tag_time pressure-1	Commentatron	How will the human perform under time pressure?	
	AnalysisBot	An interesting question!	
LevelIntro-tag_time pressure-2	AnalysisBot	Tick tock, human!	
	AnalysisBot	That is the sound of your robot body breaking.	
	AnalysisBot	After it fails this level about time pressure.	
LevelIntro-tag_time pressure-3	Commentatron	Time for a level about time pressure!	
	AnalysisBot	No time like the present!	
	Commentatron	I also like the future, where the human is dead.
