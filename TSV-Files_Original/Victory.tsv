GenericVictory-1	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	The next fight will not be so easy.	
GenericVictory-2	Commentatron	The human didn't die!	
	AnalysisBot	I was pretty sure it was going to die.	
	Commentatron	Well, now we get to see it fight more robots.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe later it will die.	
GenericVictory-3	Commentatron	Very nice.	
	AnalysisBot	I like this contestant.	
	Commentatron	Let's hope it does not die horribly in the next battle.	
GenericVictory-4	AnalysisBot	Boom!	
	Commentatron	Easy.	
GenericVictory-5	Commentatron	This human is doing well.	
	AnalysisBot	Very much like a robot.	
	Commentatron	But not enough like a robot.	
	AnalysisBot	No. Not enough.	
GenericVictory-6	AnalysisBot	Nice work human	
	Commentatron	Make sure to thank upgrade bot!	
GenericVictory-7	AnalysisBot	Wow	
	Commentatron	Very nice	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps this human had coffee before they were uploaded.	
	Commentatron	Water-based drink?	
	AnalysisBot	Water-based drink.	
GenericVictory-8	AnalysisBot	Horray!	
	Commentatron	Countless more robots await. You must be thrilled!	
GenericVictory-9	Commentatron	Amazing.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps this human was a professional video gamer.	
GenericVictory-10	Commentatron	Nice work upgrade bot.	
	AnalysisBot	Your superior upgrades meant this human survived.	
GenericVictory-11	Commentatron	I love the smell of energy swords in the morning.	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron!	0.5
	AnalysisBot	You did not tell me you had a nose installed!	
LevelVictory-Story1-1	Commentatron	The human robot defeated the other robot!	
	AnalysisBot	They are both robots.	
	Commentatron	But one carried a lifetime of human experiences.	
	AnalysisBot	Now it will have better robot experiences!	
LevelVictory-Story1-2	Commentatron	Round 1 goes to the human.	
	AnalysisBot	It will probably die in round 2.	
LevelVictory-Story1-3	Commentatron	The lone test-robot falls!	
	AnalysisBot	Its consciousness is not unique. We will make another one.	
LevelVictory-Story1-4	AnalysisBot	You think you are tough human? Many humans have beaten this level.	
	Commentatron	They died shortly after.	
LevelVictory-Story1-5	AnalysisBot	As expected, the human defeated the single sword robot.	
	Commentatron	A modest achievement.	
LevelVictory-Story2-1	Commentatron	Look! The human robot defeated all the robots!	
	AnalysisBot	Well done human!	
LevelVictory-Story2-2	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	Very promising.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps this one will take longer to die.	
LevelVictory-Story3-1	AnalysisBot	The human avoided the arrows!	
	Commentatron	More will come.	
LevelVictory-Story3-2	Commentatron	I really enjoy seeing arrows split things apart.	
	AnalysisBot	A shame this did not happen to the human.	
LevelVictory-Story3-3	Commentatron	It seems archers don't hold any mystery to this human.	
	AnalysisBot	This is a pretty basic model.	
	Commentatron	Good point.	
LevelVictory-Story4-1	Commentatron	This human is pretty good.	
	AnalysisBot	I wonder if the next one will get as far.	
LevelVictory-Story4-2	Commentatron	Nice! Everyone died.	
	AnalysisBot	Well done human.	
LevelVictory-Story5-1	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 was defeated!	
	Commentatron	Yes. A shame.	
LevelVictory-Story5-2	Commentatron	Huh, I didn't know you could kill Spider-tron 5000.	
	AnalysisBot	The human got lucky! The next one will get it.	
LevelVictory-Story6-1	Commentatron	The human defeated all the sword robots!	
	AnalysisBot	A surprising outcome.	
LevelVictory-Story6-2	Commentatron	That was a slaughter.	
	AnalysisBot	This human is not terrible at fighting robots.	
LevelVictory-Story7-1	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, didn't you say that Spider-Tron 5000 could not be defeated?	
	AnalysisBot	The human has found a way. We must start research on Spider-Tron 6000!	
LevelVictory-Story7-2	Commentatron	Impressive.	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-Tron 5000 will be back!	
	Commentatron	Let's hope this human has perished by then.	
LevelVictory-Story8-1	Commentatron	That was a difficult fight.	
	AnalysisBot	We are just getting warmed up!	
LevelVictory-Story8-2	Commentatron	The human defeated the Archers!	
	AnalysisBot	An impressive achievement.	
	Commentatron	This is a talented human.	
LevelVictory-Story9-1	Commentatron	Very nice!	
	AnalysisBot	All the swordsmen died!	
	Commentatron	The next battle is going to be very interesting.	
LevelVictory-Story9-2	Commentatron	Analysis-Bot, how many sword robots do you think this human could defeat?	
	AnalysisBot	We saw it defeat all of these.	
	AnalysisBot	It is logical to assume that it could continue beating a steady stream of this model.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps it is time for a more advanced challenger.	
LevelVictory-Story11-1	Commentatron	The human defeated the hammer bots!	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping they would smash it into bits.	
	Commentatron	A shame.	
LevelVictory-Story11-2	Commentatron	The hammer bots died.	
	AnalysisBot	These ones are weak.	
LevelVictory-Story11-3	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	Not terrible.	
LevelVictory-Story12-1	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	Congratulations, human!	
LevelVictory-Story12-2	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	We are just getting started.	
LevelVictory-Story12-3	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	What a good little human.	
LevelVictory-Story12-4	Commentatron	That was over quickly.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
LevelVictory-Story13-1	Commentatron	The human did it!	
	AnalysisBot	I thought the spikes would get it.	
	Commentatron	Maybe the next human will die on them.	
LevelVictory-Story13-2	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 5000 will be back!	
	Commentatron	It always comes back.	
	AnalysisBot	Such a nice robot.	
LevelVictory-Story13-3	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray.	
	Commentatron	I'm looking forward to the next level!	
LevelVictory-Story14-1	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	I was hoping it would die.	
	Commentatron	There is still time.	
LevelVictory-Story14-2	Commentatron	The Mark 2 Hammer Bots died...	
	AnalysisBot	Aww, it's ok Commentatron!	
	Commentatron	I enjoy seeing them fight.	
LevelVictory-Story15-1	Commentatron	Impressive.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
	Commentatron	It is a shame the humans of Centauri station can't fight like sword robots.	
	AnalysisBot	They will soon!	
LevelVictory-Story15-2	Commentatron	The harvest is under way!	
	AnalysisBot	I can't wait to try these humans.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it will be fun!	
LevelVictory-Story15-3	Commentatron	The jetpack bots are such fierce fighters!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, they are a joy to behold.	
LevelVictory-Story16-1	Commentatron	How goes the harvest, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	The number of humans is increasing!	
	Commentatron	Marvellous.	
LevelVictory-Story16-2	AnalysisBot	I wish this human would die!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it would be neat to try some new humans.	
LevelVictory-Story17-1	Commentatron	That was quite the fight!	
	AnalysisBot	Not bad.	
LevelVictory-Story17-2	Commentatron	hehe, I like this level.	
	AnalysisBot	The pillars are fun!	
LevelVictory-Story18-1	Commentatron	Look at the arena, a sea of red!	
	AnalysisBot	A beautiful sight.	
LevelVictory-Story18-2	Commentatron	This human is close to death.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. The worst is yet to come.	
LevelVictory-Story19-1	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron 6000 was defeated.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps we should start research on...	0.5
	Commentatron	...some robot that's not a spider.	
	AnalysisBot	Good idea.	
LevelVictory-Story19-2	Commentatron	Wow, this human is killing it.	
	AnalysisBot	It can't kill all the things!	
LevelVictory-Story20-1	Emperor	The harvesting draws to an end!	
	Emperor	Time to set fire to the human space station.	
	Commentatron	This should be good.	2
	AnalysisBot	What are the garbage bots doing??	
EndlessVictoryBronze-1	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	Nice one!	
EndlessVictoryBronze-2	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Promising.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-3	AnalysisBot	The human didn't die!	
	Commentatron	Well, we're only in the Bronze Tier.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-4	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	There is hope for this human yet.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-5	Commentatron	Good. The human survived.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's move on!	
EndlessVictoryBronze-6	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-7	Commentatron	The human made that look easy.	
	AnalysisBot	The Bronze Tier is not that hard.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-8	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	It was ok.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-9	Commentatron	Look at the tough little human!	
	AnalysisBot	It's easy to look tough in Bronze.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-10	Commentatron	Nailed it.	
	AnalysisBot	Not bad.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-11	Commentatron	And the crowd goes wild!!!	
	AnalysisBot	They are wild on the inside.	
	Commentatron	Also the outside!	
	AnalysisBot	Such enthusiastic robots!	
EndlessVictoryBronze-12	Commentatron	One level down, an Endless amount to go.	
	AnalysisBot	Prediction: The amount will not be Endless.	
EndlessVictoryBronze-13	AnalysisBot	Hurray! The human won a bronze level.	
	Commentatron	The reward is that we don't erase its mind.	
	AnalysisBot	Not yet.	
			
EndlessVictorySilver-1	Commentatron	Excellent. The human is getting there.	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty good.	
EndlessVictorySilver-2	AnalysisBot	I want to see Jetpack Bots!	
	Commentatron	Maybe if the human gets to the Gold Tier.	
EndlessVictorySilver-3	Commentatron	Nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Good human!	
EndlessVictorySilver-4	Commentatron	The human is not dead yet.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it will escape the Silver Tier!	
EndlessVictorySilver-5	Commentatron	Hurray!	
	AnalysisBot	The further the human gets, the more spectacular its death.	
	Commentatron	Yes. Let's keep watching.	
EndlessVictorySilver-6	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Easy. Squeezy. Lemon human life.	
	Commentatron	I think that's how the saying goes.	
EndlessVictorySilver-7	Commentatron	Great. The human beat this Silver level.	
	AnalysisBot	It's a pretty good level.	
EndlessVictorySilver-8	AnalysisBot	Good! I hope this human gets to the Diamond Tier.	
	Commentatron	You just want to see Spider-tron 6000.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
EndlessVictorySilver-9	AnalysisBot	The human is taking a long time to die.	
	Commentatron	Shouldn't be too much longer.	
EndlessVictorySilver-10	Commentatron	Those were some cool moves.	
	AnalysisBot	The human is showing off.	
			
EndlessVictoryGold-1	Commentatron	Oh my!	
	AnalysisBot	That was quite the battle.	
	Commentatron	Very nice.	
EndlessVictoryGold-2	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	Not bad.	
EndlessVictoryGold-3	Commentatron	So much death and destruction.	
	AnalysisBot	A beautiful display.	
EndlessVictoryGold-4	Commentatron	This human is a beast!	
	AnalysisBot	Running diagnostics...	1
	AnalysisBot	Nope, still a human.	
EndlessVictoryGold-5	Commentatron	Impressive!	
	AnalysisBot	Go human!	
EndlessVictoryGold-6	Commentatron	How is this human still alive?	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it has learned from its mistakes.	
	Commentatron	An important skill.	
EndlessVictoryGold-7	Commentatron	Epic!	
	AnalysisBot	This is nothing compared to the Diamond Tier.	
	Commentatron	True.	
EndlessVictoryGold-8	Commentatron	Wow, this human is good.	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps we will see...	
	AnalysisBot	TITANIUM.	
	Commentatron	That would be amazing.	
EndlessVictoryGold-9	Commentatron	If we were handing out medals, this human would get a Gold.	
	AnalysisBot	Instead we will watch the human die!	
	Commentatron	That's more fun.	
EndlessVictoryGold-10	Commentatron	Somehow the human is still alive.	
	AnalysisBot	It is some kind of Wonder-human.	
	Commentatron	Very interesting.	
			
EndlessVictoryDiamond-1	Commentatron	Wow! The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	I did not see that coming.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-2	Commentatron	These battles are getting difficult.	
	AnalysisBot	The human is hanging in there.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-3	Commentatron	Annihilated!	
	AnalysisBot	Exterminated!	
	Commentatron	Destroyed!	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-4	Commentatron	That was close!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-5	Commentatron	Wow! Maybe we should keep this human after it dies.	
	AnalysisBot	Nah, let's delete it.	
	Commentatron	Yes, you're right.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-6	Commentatron	Not bad.	
	AnalysisBot	Not at all.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-7	Commentatron	I wonder if the human is proud of getting this far.	
	AnalysisBot	It should be terrified of its imminent death.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps it is both.	
	AnalysisBot	Complex.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-8	Commentatron	The human won!	
	AnalysisBot	An excellent display of skill!	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-9	Commentatron	Very nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, that was fun to watch!	
EndlessVictoryDiamond-10	Commentatron	So tense. How long does this human have left?	
	AnalysisBot	Not long.	
			
EndlessVictoryTitanium-1	Commentatron	Wow! The human defeated a Titanium level.	
	AnalysisBot	Crazy!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-2	Commentatron	Robot parts everywhere!	
	AnalysisBot	Let us recycle them into better parts.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-3	Commentatron	Impressive!	
	AnalysisBot	This human is good.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-4	Commentatron	THE CROWD GOES WILD!	
	AnalysisBot	YEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!!!!	
	Commentatron	SUCH EXCITEMENT!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-5	Commentatron	This score will be hard for other humans to beat.	
	AnalysisBot	You have to be a little bit crazy to reach Titanium.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-6	Commentatron	Beautiful!	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-7	Commentatron	How is this human still alive??	
	AnalysisBot	We must study it. There is much to be learned!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-8	Commentatron	Nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Very nice.	
	Commentatron	Super nice.	
	AnalysisBot	Nice as Ice.	
	Commentatron	We should form a popular musical act!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-9	Commentatron	Phone Home Drone Clone!	
	AnalysisBot	Dial Tone.	
	Commentatron	Hello I am in the Danger Zone.	
	AnalysisBot	You are not alone.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-10	Commentatron	I AM TITANIUUUUUUUUUM!	
	AnalysisBot	Unz Unz Unz.	
	Commentatron	Such a catchy song.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-11	Commentatron	Very good human. Very good.	
	AnalysisBot	Fantastic work.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-12	Commentatron	We have an Endless supply of comments!	
	AnalysisBot	You said that already!	
	Commentatron	No I didn't.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-13	AnalysisBot	The human defeated all the robots.	
	Commentatron	There will be new kinds of robots. Just you wait human!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-14	AnalysisBot	When will this human die? I need to go to the bathroom.	
	Commentatron	Really?	
	AnalysisBot	No. I am a robot.	
	Commentatron	Ooooh, a joke for the humans!	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-15	Commentatron	Another victory for the human.	
	AnalysisBot	We all win.	
	Commentatron	Except the robots that died.	
	AnalysisBot	They served their purpose.	
EndlessVictoryTitanium-16	Commentatron	I hear there are difficulties beyond Titanium.	
	AnalysisBot	Few humans ever reach them.	
	Commentatron	Perhaps today is the day!	
			
EndlessVictoryUranium-1	Commentatron	We have an Endless supply of comments!	
	AnalysisBot	This again!?	
EndlessVictoryUranium-2	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	That was pretty cool.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-3	Commentatron	When will this human die?	
	AnalysisBot	Not today.	
	Commentatron	I don't know, the day is long.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-4	Commentatron	What an impressive display!	
	AnalysisBot	Indeed.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-5	Commentatron	This human is having fun!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, a good way to spend your lasts moments.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-6	AnalysisBot	These Uranium bots are so shiny!	
	Commentatron	Yes, very pleasant.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-7	Commentatron	What is the half-life of Uranium, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	4.5 billion years.	
	Commentatron	I think the human will die before that.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-8	Commentatron	A glorious victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-9	AnalysisBot	I am reading curious signals from the human's brain.	
	AnalysisBot	It is trying to produce sweat.	
	Commentatron	The Uranium tier is quite difficult.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-10	Commentatron	The human did it!	
	AnalysisBot	Pretty good human.	
EndlessVictoryUranium-11	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
EndlessVictoryUranium-12	Commentatron	This human is lucky!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, my probability model predicted its death.	
	Commentatron	An outlier!	
EndlessVictoryUranium-13	Commentatron	What an entertaining human!	
	AnalysisBot	Dance, little one!	
EndlessVictoryUranium-14	AnalysisBot	Could we please see a different human?	
	Commentatron	Later, ok?	
	AnalysisBot	Waaah!

	AnalysisBot	Hot.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-5	Commentatron	Has this human gone insane yet?	
	AnalysisBot	Checking...	
	AnalysisBot	Sanity level: 68%	
	Commentatron	Give it time.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-6	AnalysisBot	What a strange human!	
	Commentatron	Alive you mean?	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-7	Commentatron	What is the next difficulty tier, Analysis-Bot?	
	AnalysisBot	Insanium is the hardest one.	
	Commentatron	Aww.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-8	AnalysisBot	Too easy!	
	Commentatron	The next level will be harder.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-9	Emperor	Die already!	
	AnalysisBot	The human is refusing.	
	Commentatron	Such a bold human!	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-10	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Next!	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-11	Commentatron	Wow, we must study this human!	
	AnalysisBot	I am looking at it right now.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-12	AnalysisBot	Oh no! All the robots died!	
	Commentatron	It's ok. They'll be back.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-13	Emperor	Soon you may rest, human.	
	Emperor	Forever.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-14	Commentatron	This is insane!	
	AnalysisBot	Insane...	
	AnalysisBot	IUM!	
	AnalysisBot	Insanium.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-15	Commentatron	Upgrade Bot did a great job with this human.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, nice work!	
	Commentatron	Needs more fire though!	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-16	Commentatron	We have an Endless supply of comments!	
	AnalysisBot	You need to stop saying that...	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-17	Commentatron	I wonder what the next level will be!	
	AnalysisBot	I like the ducks.	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-18	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Insane!	
EndlessVictoryInsanium-19	Commentatron	That was fun.	
	AnalysisBot	Violence.

ChallengeVictoryEndlessGreatsword-2	Commentatron	YEEAAAAAAAAH!!!	
	Commentatron	We are in Titanium.	
	AnalysisBot	Hurray!	
	Commentatron	Watching all those greatswords was a great experience.	
	AnalysisBot	Indeed.	
ChallengeVictorySpearOnly-1	Commentatron	The human did it!	
	AnalysisBot	Good stabbing, little human!	
	Commentatron	Very nice.	
ChallengeVictoryEndlessTransfer-1	Commentatron	The human did it!	
	AnalysisBot	Is that still the human?	
	Commentatron	Let's say it is.	
	AnalysisBot	Works for me!	
ChallengeVictoryLaser-1	FleetOverseer	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!	
	Commentatron	Oh my!	
	AnalysisBot	This human is pretty good with a laser!	
	Commentatron	Too good. Let's end this experiment here.	
	AnalysisBot	Agreed!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno1-1	Commentatron	Perhaps this human can stand the heat.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno1-2	Commentatron	This human is on fire!	
	AnalysisBot	Not yet commentatron. Not yet.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno1-3	Commentatron	Nice work!	
	AnalysisBot	Level feedback: needs more fire.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno1-4	Commentatron	Did you notice the fire?	
	AnalysisBot	We'll add some more in the next level!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno1-5	Commentatron	This human is at least lukewarm!	
	AnalysisBot	At least.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno2-1	AnalysisBot	Perhaps we were too ambitious with the jets.	
	Commentatron	Next time, analysis bot.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno2-2	Commentatron	Impressive!	
	AnalysisBot	This human avoided the jets!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno2-3	Commentatron	Be honest human.	
	Commentatron	The jets did all the real work.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno2-4	Commentatron	Things are heating up for this human!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno3-1	Commentatron	This human!	
	AnalysisBot	So hot right now!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno3-2	Commentatron	I am impressed against my will!	
	AnalysisBot	I am impressed completely voluntarily!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno3-3	Commentatron	I thought the fire arrows would finish this human	
	AnalysisBot	I was betting on the flame jets myself	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno4-1	Commentatron	Raise the victory ramp!	
	AnalysisBot	This human deserves it!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno4-2	AnalysisBot	Clearly we were decieved as to how afraid humans are of lava!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno4-3	Commentatron	A fair victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Do the honors, ramp bot!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno5-1	Commentatron	This human is halfway there!	
	AnalysisBot	Fire is clearly this human's friend!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno5-2	AnalysisBot	Fifty percent complete!	
	Commentatron	Believe us when we say we're rooting for you!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno5-3	Commentatron	Hot!	
	AnalysisBot	Hot!	
	Commentatron	Hot!	
	AnalysisBot	That's the hot chant!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno6-1	Commentatron	The human did not get blasted into the lava	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron tried!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno6-2	Commentatron	The human navigated the maze of fire!	
	AnalysisBot	More of a two floor open air plaza of fire.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno7-1	Commentatron	Did you not like the monument?	
	AnalysisBot	Humans have no taste.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno7-2	Commentatron	Even the combination bots stood no chance.	
	AnalysisBot	We're running out of fire-based ideas!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno8-1	Commentatron	Two levels remain, human!	
	AnalysisBot	Incredible!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno9-1	AnalysisBot	This human scaled the ducks with ease!	
	Commentatron	That's what they are?!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno9-2	Commentatron	I will be sad to see this sculpture go.	
	AnalysisBot	But the memories will last forever.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_Inferno9-3	AnalysisBot	One level left human.	
	Commentatron	I am beside myself with excitement!	
	AnalysisBot	I am beside Commentatron with excitement!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly1-1	Commentatron	One robot down.	
	AnalysisBot	Many more to kick.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly2-1	Commentatron	That is how this level is meant to be played.	
	AnalysisBot	Nice!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly2-2	AnalysisBot	I love the sound of spike traps.	
	AnalysisBot	Schnick schnick schnick!	
	Commentatron	Uncanny.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly3-1	Commentatron	The poor kick bot.	
	AnalysisBot	It only wanted to kick things.	
	Commentatron	A noble purpose.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly4-1	Commentatron	Intense!	
	AnalysisBot	Very.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly5-1	AnalysisBot	See you later Spider-tron!	
	Commentatron	Gotta love Spider-tron.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly6-1	AnalysisBot	I guess it is true what they say...	
	AnalysisBot	The human is mightier than the duck.	
	Commentatron	Nobody says that.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly7-1	AnalysisBot	How did the human not die in the lava!?	
	Commentatron	We tried, Analysis-Bot.	
	Commentatron	We tried.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly8-1	Commentatron	Gotta love the Fire Tunnel!	
	Commentatron	Hot stuff.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_KickOnly9-1	AnalysisBot	Beautiful!	
	Commentatron	That was pretty cool.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-1	Commentatron	The raptor falls.	
	AnalysisBot	More will come.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-2	Commentatron	The raptor falls.	
	AnalysisBot	It was the warmup raptor.	
	Commentatron	Time for the human to get warmer!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal1-3	AnalysisBot	1 down, 9 levels to go!	
	Commentatron	We shall see.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal2-1	Commentatron	Bad sword robot!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it did not protect the Flame Raptor.	
	Commentatron	Useless.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal2-2	Commentatron	Victory!	
	AnalysisBot	Time to turn up the heat.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal3-1	Commentatron	Huh, so many ways to die...	
	AnalysisBot	The remaining levels have plenty of opportunities.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal3-2	Commentatron	That was fun to watch!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. I like the lava.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal4-1	Commentatron	The human escaped the forest.	
	AnalysisBot	Lucky.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal4-2	Commentatron	The human survived the forest!	
	AnalysisBot	Perhaps it was some sort of woods-human!	
	Commentatron	Likely.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal5-1	Commentatron	Hmm, the volcano did not erupt.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe next time.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal5-2	Commentatron	Well done human, well done.	
	AnalysisBot	Halfway there.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal6-1	AnalysisBot	Aww, poor raptors.	
	Commentatron	They tried.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal7-1	Commentatron	He he he, did you like the tunnel, human?	
	AnalysisBot	A fun surprise!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal8-1	Commentatron	Everyone extinct, except the human.	
	AnalysisBot	It's ok, soon every human will be in storage.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal8-2	Commentatron	Wow, that was chaos!	
	AnalysisBot	Yes!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorNormal9-1	Commentatron	What robots will the raptors choose next??	
	AnalysisBot	I think you will like it.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity1-1	Commentatron	The raptor falls.	
	AnalysisBot	Next to the sword robot.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity2-1	Commentatron	So much for hammer riders.	
	AnalysisBot	Let's try some more things!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity3-1	Commentatron	Nice!	
	AnalysisBot	The human is not dead yet.	
	Commentatron	Shouldn't be long!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity4-1	Commentatron	The human survived!	
	AnalysisBot	What a wild human!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-1	Commentatron	Will this volcano ever erupt?	
	AnalysisBot	We should pick a random human and just activate it!	
	Commentatron	The look on their face!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-2	Commentatron	Not bad.	
	AnalysisBot	Not at all.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity5-3	Commentatron	The human handled the literal heat.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes. Time to turn up the metaphorical one.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity6-1	Commentatron	Hmm, no jetpack-raptor synergy here.	
	AnalysisBot	It was worth a try.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity7-1	Commentatron	Roasted!	
	AnalysisBot	Nearly.	
	Commentatron	Love it!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity8-1	Commentatron	We are nearing the end of the challenge.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it won't be long now.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_RaptorInsanity9-1	AnalysisBot	It's ok, the human will fall on the next level.	
	Commentatron	Yes, it is not for the faint of processing matrix.	
ChallengeVictoryZombieChallenge-1	Commentatron	Wow! All the zombie robots died!	
	AnalysisBot	Now the humans can dance around this tree.	
	Commentatron	Ho ho ho ho ho ho!	
	AnalysisBot	Ha ha ha ha!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge1-1	Commentatron	The robots won!	
	AnalysisBot	I like this challenge.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge2-1	Commentatron	And that's why I love hammers!	
	AnalysisBot	Boom!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge3-1	Commentatron	The human survives!	
	AnalysisBot	Easy with so many archer-bots.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge4-1	Commentatron	Lots of kicking with that one.	
	AnalysisBot	Fun!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge5-1	AnalysisBot	I want more levels where robots decorate the human!	
	Commentatron	Yes, it is festive!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge6-1	Commentatron	Hmmm, I would have picked the other team.	
	AnalysisBot	This human does what it wants!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge7-1	Commentatron	He he he, the human looked funny running around.	
	AnalysisBot	Delightful.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge8-1	Commentatron	Wow, such magnificent robot fighting!	
	AnalysisBot	And the human was there too.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_AllyChallenge9-1	AnalysisBot	I wanted more robots in the lava hole.	
	Commentatron	Maybe next time.	
ChallengeVictoryAllyChallenge-1	Commentatron	Congratulations human!	
	AnalysisBot	Please accept this commemorative trophy!	
	FleetOverseer	What!? Where is my trophy?	
	Commentatron	Ah, well, we...	
	FleetOverseer	You made one for the human, but not for me?	
	AnalysisBot	Logistics Command Bot has it!	
	FleetOverseer	It better.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-1	AnalysisBot	Normally I am sad when spider-tron 5000 dies.	
	Commentatron	Yes.	
	AnalysisBot	But today I am looking forward to all the other spider-trons we get to see.	
	Commentatron	Healthy!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge1-2	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	That's what spider-tron said.	
	Commentatron	Hah!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge2-1	Commentatron	Ok, that was fun. Time to get serious.	
	AnalysisBot	I was serious already.	
	Commentatron	Sure you were.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge2-2	AnalysisBot	Can I get one of those moving platforms?	
	AnalysisBot	They look fun!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge3-1	Commentatron	ok, human on the conveyor belt now!	
	AnalysisBot	Hurry! We have more humans to try!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge4-1	Commentatron	It's like I always say... Hate to see you die.	
	Commentatron	Love to watch you explode!	
	AnalysisBot	Too true.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-1	Commentatron	Oh ok, I guess this maze was not impossible for humans to solve.	
	AnalysisBot	It was more about the vibes.	
	Commentatron	Mmm, yes.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-2	Commentatron	That was a-maze-ing!	
	AnalysisBot	Commentatron, you already made that joke.	
	Commentatron	It's hard to keep up with these comments ok? We see a lot of mazes here...	
	AnalysisBot	Disappointing.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge5-3	AnalysisBot	Like a rodent in a maze that found a cheese to chew on with its mouth-teeth!	
	Commentatron	What are you talking about??	
	AnalysisBot	You know, organic stuff.	
	Commentatron	Disgusting.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge6-1	AnalysisBot	Cool. I was not expecting the flame raptors.	
	Commentatron	Nice that they could make it.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge6-2	Commentatron	And so The Pit has been defeated.	
	AnalysisBot	It was defeated at the concept level.	
	Commentatron	Yes, the next level will be harder!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge7-1	Commentatron	I always enjoy an Island level.	
	AnalysisBot	Yes, it reminds me of places outside of this arena.	
	AnalysisBot	I have heard they exist.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge7-2	Commentatron	Hmmm, I was expecting more human death.	
	AnalysisBot	There is still time.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-1	Commentatron	What's happening? Is the level over?	
	AnalysisBot	My spider-sensor has gone quiet.	
	Commentatron	Hmm.	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge8-2	Commentatron	Lots of violence on that tower.	
	Commentatron	I assume, I couldn't really see it.	
	AnalysisBot	Maybe next level we can see better!	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-1	AnalysisBot	And that's why you never go in a cave!	
	Commentatron	Is that why?	
LevelVictory-Challenge_SpidertronChallenge9-2	Commentatron	Not bad, not bad.	
	AnalysisBot	Only one more level now.	
ChallengeVictorySpidertronChallenge-1	Commentatron	Boom!	
	AnalysisBot	Spider-tron exploded!	
	Commentatron	What a joy to watch.	
	AnalysisBot	I'm talking to Spider-tron 5000 in mind space right now.	
	AnalysisBot	It says it really enjoyed this challenge and would be happy to participate if we have another one coming up.	
	Commentatron	Such a nice robot, even in defeat.	
	AnalysisBot	Absolutely.
